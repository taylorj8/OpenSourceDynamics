You can also find information on hotfixes here.\nMaintaining documentation for old versions of Flutter is currently not supported :) Though, I think your IDE is your best tool here with the linter telling you what works and what doesn't.\nMy recommendation is that you do upgrade to newer versions of Flutter. The SDK not being backwards compatible might be a good thing for your users if they have to upgrade their Flutter version to use it, as new Flutter versions provide not only great new features, but also fixes a lot of bugs, some of them quite critical.\nI know it's not ideal, but unfortunately, there's nothing we can do currently :) Therefore, I will close this issue.

I have multiple Firebase configurations in my application for each environment (dev, prod, etc.). It would appear that the process of building the apk somehow depends on the runtime initialization of Firebase.\nFor context, the project is set up to use the prod Firebase environment using the flutterfire cli at build time. This is then overwritten at runtime if the app is deployed to another environment like dev.\nThe working code that universally lets me build a working apk inside main.dart's main():\n  await Firebase.initializeApp(\n    options: ProductionFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,\n  );\nThe code I want, but only builds a working apk when built from Windows:\n  await Firebase.initializeApp(\n    options: () {\n      switch (env) {\n        // Defining use of the emulator is done below. The envLocalhost\n        // definition isn't important here so just point at develop.\n        case envLocalhost:\n        case envDevelop:\n          return DevelopFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform;\n        case envProduction:\n        default:\n          return ProductionFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform;\n      }\n    }.call(),\n  );\nSee my initial post for surrounding code.\nI'm pretty sure this is not expected behavior on Flutter and might be worth taking a look into.",

(This may be  be solved by saving the height of the keyboard, but there are two keyboard heights for ios, one is the height of the system keyboard, and the other is the height of the emoji keyboard that comes with the system. If you need to detect and save these two heights, I think this is not an elegant approach)\nFinaly,english is not my mother tongue,The description may not be very accurate, sorry.",
