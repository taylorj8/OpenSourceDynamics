We should not stomp builds with different target outputs.\n\nShould we include aarch64 rootfs in the Flutter SDK?\n\nThis seems out of scope for Flutter; we don't ship and use a sysroot for the current builds.\n\nWe will need infra updates so that you can download artifacts (Flutter Eingine build results, etc.) to the following locations.\n\nThis would be the first place to start, IMO. We also need confirmation/commitment from Dart folks that cross-compile tooling (e.g., for gen_snapshot) is a supported configuration on Linux.",

If so, does it mean \"same as host\" or \"x64\"?\n\nNo, it isn't. I'm sorry for confusing you. I updated the description. Now, I want to run the Flutter SDK on an arm64 host.\n\nHow should the build output be structured for multi-arch output?\n\nAt the time of self-build, the build output will be output to build/linux/. It's the same as the current output directory structure. On the other hand, at the time of cross-build, it will be output to build/linux-cross/.\nHow about my idea?\n\nFor Linux, how is the sysroot handled?\n\nI have considered that an user can specify a sysroot prepared by themselves in the build option. I think it would be better to have an option for them to freely specify sysroot. Because Flutter Engine has similar options.\n$ flutter build linux --target-platform=linux-arm64 --target-sysroot=/target-sysroot-path\n\nBut If the Flutter SDK download the sysroot used to cross-build the Flutter Engine first, they don't need to prepare anything.",

These weren't questions about how your patch works, these are questions that all stakeholders need to agree on what we want the solutions to be, not only for Linux, but for other platforms where we need this in the future such as Windows.

So I guess the only thing that qualifies is an Overlay/_RenderTheatre?",

In that world you could potentially put more then one route on the stack per frame and you need to guarantee ordering somehow. OverlayPortals could in the future also be used to animate multiple parts of a UI to a new position when e.g. the window size changes.

There are certain widgets that should not flow into the View. One example is the Material widget. If you use a button in a subview, it should not see the Material widget in the main view because it doesn't make sense to draw the sparkles of the subview button into the main view. Instead, it should require that there is a Material widget in the subview itself.\nI think it is the same for portals.\nAlso, we should make sure that OverlayPortals are a drop-in replacement for Views. Basically, OverlayPortals simulate sub-windows. We should probably hold off on this until the View stuff is a little further along. Fitting in Overlay Boundaries retro-actively doesn't sound like a good idea.",

In short: we see that, with the current template, developers introduce breaking changes to the template in the first 5 minutes of their work, and then the smoke test is broken (often statically broken, so there are analyzer errors and squiggly lines). The effect is that the (otherwise very educational!) test/widget_test.dart file gets deleted or commented out. For that reason, the approach is to have relatively trivial tests that can't be broken (they don't depend on lib/) but that still provide some boilerplate (test('...', () {})) and links to documentation.\nNothing here is set in stone, though.",

                "bodyText": "Thanks @csells, replies inline:\n\nthe settings page action is hidden behind the debug banner, which could be mitigated with a tooltip\n\nWe were aware of the issue but decided to prioritize simplicity of code. What do you mean by mitigating the issue with a tooltip?\n\nI would expect settings to be a dialog on the desktop form factor and not a page to navigate to\n\nThat would make the code a lot more complex, and isn't necessarily all that clear cut. Desktop apps often open a completely separate window for settings screens, which would make things even harder to implement.\n\nI normally find myself having a shared Scaffold and AppBar between pages to reduce the duplicated code while providing a consistent UI between pages\n\nWe explored this. In many cases, AppBar will be meaningfully different between pages. This can be mitigated by creating a custom widget, of course, but that would make the template more complex. And it's something where we don't need to educate. The template educates about things like file structure, but extracting widget is something an intermediate developer is perfectly capable of.\nIn short, this goes back to the goals of the template: getting out of the way of an intermediate/advanced developer.\n\nthe item details page has no Settings actions\n\nThat is intentional. In most apps we're seeing, app-level settings aren't accessible from everywhere. Of course, a desktop app has its settings in the menu, so in that sense, it's available everywhere. But again, this is something an intermediate developer should be able to implement themselves. And it allows us to save code that would otherwise need to be understood, modified and/or deleted by the developer.\n\nI would expect the strings \"Dummy Items\" and \"Item Details\" to be in the arb and for the code to use them\nall of the tests except the first two in implementation_test.dart have great comments; would like great comments in all tests\n\nThis is also intentional. We've seen that developers, when starting projects, don't immediately implement i18n everywhere. It really damages perceived developer productivity when, instead of Text('OK') you have to write the i18n equivalent (in several files).\nIn the template, we show how to go about doing i18n in Flutter, and give you the files in the right places and with the right contents, but don't implement it fully for you. As a developer, you'd be deleting most of it anyway.",

Yes, we should adjust, but how do I \"print\" what a Render is painting so I can compare (and possibly adjust) the test? I don't know how to do this.\nComparing BoxDecoration with ShapeDecoration, I found that ShapeDecoration ALWAYS adds Padding to Container (usually zero). Therefore, I made it null when the decorator is used + padding zero (f4088d1). Container(padding: zero) will still render as Padding(Container) (I don't know why this is wanted, but I'm not changing this behavior).",

It's the last bit that's relevant. It should tell you what is being rendered, and you can change the paints... expectations to call the right methods based on what it lists. So far example,  when it says:\nExpected: Object or closure painting:\n          'a rounded rectangle with Color(0x52000000), RRect: RRect.fromLTRBR(13.0, 17.0, 46.0,\n31.0, 7.0)'\n          'a circle with Color(0x33000000)'\n          'a circle with Color(0x24000000)'\n          'a circle with Color(0x1f000000)'\n          'a circle with Color(0xfffafafa)'\n  Actual: _RenderInkFeatures:<_RenderInkFeatures#61c17>\n   Which: did not match the pattern.\n          It called 5 other methods on the canvas, the first of which was drawPath(Instance of\n'Path', Paint(Color(0x33000000))), but did not call drawCircle() at the time where a circle with\nColor(0x33000000) was expected.\n\n...you want to find where we expect(..., paints..drawCircle()) and replace it with expect(..., paints..drawPath()) (because Which: comment says it calls drawPath).

                "bodyText": "Benchmarks\nWe have benchmarks!!!! I made a Switch (the widget that's by far the most affected by this change) many times, applied an animation, and executed the benchmark: 10x, 100x, 1000x, many times.\n@Hixie is right. ShapeDecoration can be 20% slower than BoxDecoration. But I'm not giving up. I compared ShapeDecoration with BoxDecoration and found the biggest difference. It is not preCache. It is path! DrawPath is slow. DrawCircle is fast. Optimizing _paintInterior gave a bit of performance, but it was still much slower. paintShadows gave the boost we needed. I'm not killing pre-cache, I'm just changing it to pre-cache the bounds instead of the path (when possible, else do everything else as always).\nWhile optimizing Circle, I optimized Oval and while optimizing Oval I also optimized RoundedRectangle. You know what, I'm changing everything anyway.\nFirst optimized benchmark with Switch (now uses CircleBorder):\n\nThen RoundedRectangleBorder:\n\nImplementation details:\nI added a function and a getter to ShapeBorder (Hixie is going to kill me, twice): hasOptimizedPaintBox and paintBox. I'm too mentally exhausted to think in better names.\npaintBox calls canvas.drawRect, canvas.drawCircle, etc. It \"replaces\" getOuterPath for 80% of the borders. They don't need it anymore (but it is still there, of course).\nThis is how it works:\n\nShapeDecoration wants to draw a circle, paintBox is called.\nShapeDecoration wants to draw a path, same cache as always.\nTo control this flow, there is hasOptimizedPaintBox. When true, ShapeBorder doesn't cache the Path and calls paintBox (which, if it has drawPath, might be slower, I didn't test, but will work fine). I wish paintBox were an optional function that we could check if it exists before caching or not. I don't think Dart allows this, so the second variable is doing this.\n\nAs a side effect from my last change, I'm reverting the tests and fixing others.\nInstead of changing circle to path, now we are going from path to rrect! It seems a great change.\n\n  Code I used for benchmark here!\nYou can change that function to anything:\nMaterialApp(\n      home: Scaffold(\n        body: Wrap(children: [\n          for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)\n            SizedBox(\n                width: 100,\n                height: 100,\n                child: Center(\n                  child: _RotatingWidget(\n                    child: Container(\n                      width: 50,\n                      height: 50,\n                      decoration: BoxDecoration(\n                        color: Colors.red,\n                        // shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(\n                        borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(25),\n                      // )\n                      ),\n\n                    ),\n                  ),\n                )),\n        ]),\n      ),\n    );\n// Copyright 2014 The Flutter Authors.

I can also make a list of lists; which do you prefer? [].key/[].value or [][0], [][1]?\nI don't trust my benchmark, I made muuuultiple runs, the values are always changing, and I don't have a controlled environment, but it seems avoiding that loop really improves my test (300x runs with 25 switches rotating).\nI also tested calling shadow.toSide() on draw time, and seems to be also faster, but caching everything ended up being even better.",

Even though I think shape: BoxShape is extreeeemly confusing (since there is the shape: RoundedRectangleBorder) and I wish we could rename it for something better (material primary -> foreground was a lot less bad). I don't think we are not going to remove it (for now). Can we go with better names?\nMeanwhile I am, against my will, giving BoxDecoration a reason to exist; I'm adding non-uniform borders there, since we can't have it in ShapeBorder (natively, at least, for now, at least. My package does it: https://github.com/bernaferrari/non_uniform_border). I still like the 'remove boxShape' idea, I'm just thinking on alternatives since it's been a while and we can't move forward.\nRef: #121921\nDo you agree with the non-removal and request for a better name? I'm also fine if we remove it, ShapeDecoration is better, if we remove we free the user from a bunch of possible exceptions... but the PR has hit a roadblock for a few months now and no one knows how to solve the internal google bug. If you could also solve that bug, it would be great...\nThinking smaller, I wish:\n\nBoxDecoration(boxShadow: ) became BoxDecoration(shadows: ) (so it matches ShapeDecoration\nBoxDecoration(shape: ) became BoxDecoration(boxShape: ) (wouldn't conflict with shape from everywhere else)\n\nWe could make the migration with Dart fix, life would go on..

Maybe eventually we should have a \"strategy\" class, so that iOS monodrag, iOS panning, and Android dragging should have separate strategies.\n\nI am confused about the iOS scrolling, the iOS panning, and the iOS monodrag what you mentioned, I am newer to iOS, after my investigation, it seems only the pan gesture is about scrolling in the picture below (Whether single finger or multiple).UIPanGestureRecognizer. Can you give me more explanation? Thank you for your patience!\n\n\nMaybe eventually we should have a \"strategy\" class, so that iOS monodrag, iOS panning, and Android dragging should have separate strategies.\n\nThe logic in this fixed refers the iOS because the experience of iOS is better than Android.

See, for example, this commit: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/23438/files#diff-89970c613560f892af5f6c393a52d2c0R3\n(Unless your CI is regenerating that file, which I think should only be happening if you're testing flutter create for some reason.)\n\nI am working on the beta channel and I applied the manual fix but still get the same errors. The cause for me seems to stem from the following line apply from: \"$flutterRoot/packages/flutter_tools/gradle/flutter.gradle\" which resides in my android/app/build.gradle. Apply the same manual fix to flutter.gradle then fixes the issue, but that's just the same as me manually back-porting the fix in this PR. Being new to flutter I tried removing the line which applies flutter.gradle thinking it might not be needed for non demo apps, but I just got more errors. Not really sure what to try from here other than just leaving the flutter.gradle modified until this change makes it into the beta channel.",

However, proxying seems to be broken quite regularly (there were also long threads in Twitter about it not long time ago). Its better to use google's repository directly for any artifacts that are available there and fallback to jcenter for those that do not exist. Many times in order to fix a gradle build, adding google's repo as a first option, is the way to go. Therefore, in my opinion, its better to keep the commit.",

We might be able to bring that in by setting connectionTimeout on the HttpClient. Of course, that won't help if the client is already connected, and is timing out afterwards.\nHowever, client request output is buffered (buffer size 8KB): https://api.dart.dev/dev/2.10.0-146.0.dev/dart-io/HttpClientRequest/bufferOutput.html, so we might not be trying to connect and send anything until the close() call.\nIf we think the transfer is taking too long, we should use abort() https://api.dart.dev/dev/2.10.0-146.0.dev/dart-io/HttpClientRequest/abort.html after the timeout to clean up the connection properly instead of leaking it for 4 minutes.\nAs @jmagman says however, it would be nice to find the root cause before adding the timeout, but adding the timeout is not terrible here since we've already got a retry loop.",

I've filed an issue.\nWe already have timeouts for this call.  They are 4 minutes long which is dictated by Dart.  This timeout is one that is more amenable to our users and is 50x the observed duration during normal operation.  Closing the request happens after the data has already been sent, so we do know how long it should take.  The call before close is the one that scales based on the size of the payload.\nRegardless, the devfs sync operation retries 10 times, so even if it somehow prematurely times out, it would have to exhibit the pathological case 9 more times and prematurely timeout 9 times which is highly unlikely.  (in the bug reports and my observation the stalled asset has always succeeded the second time).",

I think this is an artifact of the result that we are parallelizing the sending of the files, but the server is handling them serially.  That means payload size does indirectly affect the time it takes to wait for the status code (not in network cost, but processing cost).  It also means that retry attempts will have lower likelihood of timing out as the server load lessens (assuming some tasks converge).\nThese tests are also running on server farms with emulated devices so I expect their numbers to be higher than anyone would experience in any sane setup.  This speaks to the need to find the root cause in the server even more.  A safe number would be 10x the observed max which would be 50 seconds, which is still better than the current 4 minute timeout.  It is hardly an acceptable pause to receive 20% of the time.",

The reason is that I likely need some time to get boundaries correct after rotation (there is a TODO in the code with more about this).\nMy API decision to pass-through all the GestureDetector listeners is very verbose. Is there a more concise way to achieve the same? Document for the user how to transform the coordinates themselves?  I wrote some notes about this in the PR description above. Hans helped me improve this API. See onInteraction.\nThere is an underlying Flutter problem with using drag targets inside of InteractiveViewer, see the PR description above.\nI think the tests are failing due to the weird version error, and I need to squash all the commits. Will do that soon. Done and fixed.\nLet me know if the API could be improved at all!",

If so, you could leave the current behavior as the default, and it would not be breaking.\n\nMy concern with this is that it would be accepting broken behaviour as the default. Since these methods represent a 'push and...' transition, future developers should be able to expect a normal push animation and not be required to opt-in to it. Agreed that it might be a breaking change for some that opted to work around the problem rather than post a fix, but think default behaviour should be correct and favour future developers, in which case the break for the few may be necessary. Hopefully those that were relying on the broken feature should have accepted that it is likely to be fixed at some point in the future?\nIf we introduce optional behaviour, should this be unique to the 'push and...' operations? or for consistency should the secondaryAnimation be optional for other operations such as push() too? It feels contrary to the purpose of exposing the secondaryAnimation to transition builders to use if/as they see fit if there is an option somewhere else to determine if secondaryAnimation is just a dummy parameter - how would the transition builder know if it is a dummy and using it would have no effect?\nI'm happy to amend to introduce more functionality, just want to make sure we fix what is broken rather than treat it as an unintended feature.",

We require notification before to ensure secondary animations behave correctly, and I also believe subsequent actions should responsible for change notifications (no tests fail if it is removed)\nI will therefore remove the 'after' notifications from both methods. @Piinks - looks like you might have introduced/edited the pushAndRemoveUntil()'s didChangeNext()  notification after the transition.

I don't think we can risk calling both back-to-back, though. This is fine for the situation where we have routes A-B-C and C replaces B - C label will end up indicating A, after very briefly indicating B.\nBut what if C replaces A and B? in that case, C label will indicate B (precedingRoute), there is no newPrecedingRoute. The result is then a route pointing back to a route that doesn't exist. This isn't something we should fix after the transition either, as it should animate in with the correct value.\nTherefore, I suggest that it is safe (and necessary) for both precedingRoute and newPrecedingRoute to have next pointing to newRoute, but that newRoute previous should only be set to the ultimate preceding route (if any).\nIt is confusing that B->C but A<-C, but think it is necessary. Hopefully you can clean up the terminology in the larger refactor.\nHope that all makes sense!",

And you're talking about the case where the strokeAlign is \"outside\", not the default case of \"inside\", right? Because I think that for rounded rects, it's expected that the rounded edge appears as it goes outside, since it inflates the rect. The problem is that if you do want an actual rect with an outside border, we don't have a border for that.\nWe could do some kind of crazy thing where we draw values less than 2 pixels differently from the rest of the values, making the \"outside\" alignments draw a progressively sharper rectangle as they approach zero. Then the lerp would really quickly go from square to round from 0 to 2.  That might be the best option, if we can work it out. It would need to match up neatly when it hits two pixels.\n\nDeciding the StrokeAlign vs BorderSide.strokeAlignInside situation.\n\nYou know what I think about this.

ThemeData.primarySwatch[600]\ndark mode: Colors.tealAccent[200]\nand ThemeData.primarySwatch would default to Colors.blue if null.\n\nI looked into this.\nIf you look at the specs https://material.io/components/switches#theming, ColorScheme secondary is the only color to be used. Colors defined in toggleableActiveColor are hard coded. Looks like it was created when ThemeData.primarySwatch was more prominent part of the theme system, now it is largely ignored.\nIMO, this migration doesn't need to be compatible with ThemeData.primarySwatch since it is also need to be deprecated.\ntheme_data largely ignores primarySwatch when brightness is set to dark and Darren Austin's comment  also indicates ColorScheme colors should be default (matching Material specs here too).\n\nIn this case they are broken because ColorScheme.secondary is a different default.\n\nIMO, ColorScheme.secondary is slightly lighter blue by default hence the difference (also native switch is ligher too compared to the one created using `toggleableActiveColor but it is a spec accurate color regardless of the theme brightness (ColorScheme.secondary). In fact track color is even lighter in native Android.\n\n\n\nFlutter\nAndroid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince ColorScheme.secondary is the new default for radio buttons, should it reflect these colors in this case?\n\nI think widgets should reflect ColorScheme.secondary.\n\nIt looks like this constructor does not set the ColorScheme.secondary when a colorScheme is not provided.\n\nDefault ColorScheme.secondary color  is returned when no colorScheme is provided. Widgets are still blue when you don't define ColorScheme.\n    return const MaterialApp(\n      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,\n      home: Example(),\n    );\nIn cases where  ColorScheme.secondary is already defined but it is a different color than what is defined in ThemeData.toggleableActiveColor, app should not break since fix overrides the component themes to match existiing toggleableActiveColor, if component is already defined, fix applies .copyWith and adds toggleableActiveColor color for each widget.\n\nIt's just worth double checking on a breaking change.\n\nAgreed. Without looking at specific customer tests, i cannot say if this is deal breaker and how to overcome this if needed but looking the specs and deprecate primarySwatch issue. I cannot find anything else to fix here.",

still think it's a bit much and we should collapse it. Since it spans so many pages, it's hard to glance at the CLI output and know what to do with it. The CLI output should be a summarizing signal for users to look one page and be like, oh sounds reasonable, or oh assets seem larger than expected, let's open devtools.\nAt least it should show sums per directory instead of only sizes of each individual file.",

Similarly for the windows output in the PR description, having Dart AOT symbols accounted decompressed size be a sibling or, in the mac case, a node on a higher level is confusing.

There are often times when we want to find out if the input is valid (with the validator) without necessarily having to show the error message to the user. With autovalidate and errorStateMatcher, this approach can keep hasError always up to date and always reflects the validity of the input while not showing the error, and this is something we currently cannot do easily.\nFurthermore, this type of error-after-touch form field is quite common in today's UX design. I'd even argue that it makes sense to become the default behavior of a form field out of the box. This errorStateMatcher approach can provide an easy and convenient way to implement this without having to use any state variable or any repetitive logic. I'd hate having to copy a bunch of boilerplate code and repeat the touched checking logic for every simple form field I implement.\nAs pointed out in #18885 by others, the lack of this feature marks a notable feature parity between Flutter and Angular, and adding this can help bridge the feature gap.",

It is not nice to have to put touched check in the validator, because that would mix the UI logic with the actual validation.

We only want to show user the error if:\n\nuser touched the field\nor user clicks on the submit button, where we will call Form.validate() and decide whether to proceed or show all the error\nIn second case, all of the Field that hasn't been touched will not show an error because it has never been touched.

The ErrorStateMatcher is borrowed from Angular.\n\nWould it be sufficient to add a flag to Form that defers highlighting invalid fields until the user has provided input?\n\nI think the solution @SpajicM proposed is good. Yes, we definitely need to let the user customize when they want the auto validation to perform, but I'd like to cover at least the following 4 cases:\n\nalways (current behavior)\ntouched\nsaved\n(touched || saved)  => The use case @tjonganthony pointed out earlier is a good example of when (touched || saved) can be quite useful.\n\nIf we could cover the above 4 cases then the flag should be efficient for most use cases IMO.\nHowever, I do think the concept of having an errorStateMatcher can offer more flexibility because the user can have their custom-defined variables in there.

This is an example of when the we don't want to show errors just on blur, but also make sure it's been touched. The && operator can avoid the situation when the user was just tabbing through (switching between input fields) without editing anything.\nThere are quite a few cases we need to cover, as stated above, and they might need to be combined with multiple logical operators (&&, ||, and !) creating even more permutations with more flags.\nUsing bitwise operators to combine flags is nice, but currently Dart does not support Enum with values (dart-lang/language#158). Also, I don't often encounter the syntax of enum flags with bitwise operators in Dart, especially within Flutter. It is questionable if we should encourage this syntax.\n\nYour thoughts?",

It's not uncommon to see validate() being called in  onSaved or onChanged. Why should onInteraction be different and cannot be used with autovalidate? Should we put this restriction on the framework itself? People might come up with other use cases for onInteraction other than just validating errors. Is there a bit of an overlapping between onInteraction and other event callbacks? Would this confuse users into choosing onInteraction when they could otherwise just go for onChanged, for example?\nIs this onInteraction per field, or would it make sense to add this callback to the Form as well? How would some of the attributes make sense if it's per form? For example: Would focused be attributed to any of its child fields having focus, and also pass that field as a parameter so you can validate() just for that field that has focus?\nBoth \"validator\" and \"autovalidate\" are available per form too. I think it'd be very useful to apply at a higher level -- per form, and even per app default. I was even thinking having this callback under MaterialApp so they can set their defaultErrorStateMatcher (or whatever you call it) globally for the whole app. Being able to set this globally IMO is more useful than per field for this feature.

Event callbacks should be specific and relevant to the event they want to handle. onInteraction feels like an all-encompassing callback that handles all events without specificity. E.g. I'd want my onChanged and onBlur being separate callbacks instead of dumping them into a single big callback with a bunch of if-statements.\nI'm also confused by what the bool flags in onInteration actually mean:\n\nAre they supposed to be indicate what the event is (changed means it's an onChanged event, a subsequent save event will have changed to be false), or do they represent the sustained state since beginning (changed means the value has been changed and will not turn back to false until reset)?\nThe name onInteration gives me the impression that I can go if (changed) print(\"This is a onChanged event\"), but it feels conflicting because I'm also under the impression that shown and focused represents a state that can be true regardless of what event it is.\nIf that only indicates the event type, then focused and shown will be false during an onChanged event, that'd be very confusing. And the users might have to again record the actual state using their own variables themselves. This defeats the whole purpose.\nIf they are just sustained states, how does the name onInteraction make sense, since you won't even know what is the interaction that triggered this? It's kind of like an all-encompassing onStateChange event without highlighting what's being changed.  Should we also pass all previous states so they'd know what's changed (e.g. if (prev.focused != new.focused) print(\"onFocusChange\"))?  Even then, we cannot find out if it's an onChanged event because changed stays true for other events too.\n\nCan those bool flags become getters on the FormFieldState? So you can use just field.hasFocus?\nAlso on a side note, we'd need separate variables to track focus gains (focused) and losses (blurred). Otherwise, we can't validate on blur. focused == false does not mean it's blurred. For error validation, I'm not interested in if it currently has focus, but whether it has ever gained focus, or has ever lost focus.\n\nSo if onInteration is defined at form level, all its fields should behave like you've put onInteraction on the field itself. If field has its own onInteraction, then it should use that.\n\nWould it be helpful if we pass the FormState in onInteration as well?

The aim here is only to make it more convenient, with less verbose syntax, and get rid of more boilerplate code.\n\nIt aims to make the usual cases more easy - if you need something custom, like knowing the previous state, you'll have to write it yourself.\n\nHaving to define this attribute for every field / form adds another layer of verbosity, more boilerplate code.\n\nIn my opinion, it's not really boilerplate if it defines your functionality.\nIt's not the code everyone has to write to get the one same result (like for example setOnClickListeners in Android/Java)\n\nI'm concerned that the onInteraction would become a rabbit hole jumble of logics, for the lack of a better expression\n\nI agree it's not an ideal separation here, but I also think you pushed your example a bit too far for common use case. What your example shows is flexibility - but most commonly it's gonna be\nif (saved || blurred || changed) {\n    form.validate();\n}\nwhich doesn't look so bad to me.",

I'll also be keeping an eye out for ways to improve the API.\nThanks to everyone that has chimed in on this and especially @chen-yumin for opening the PR.

Since the test would be testing web-specific functionality, I would suggest to also use conditional imports in the test and import dart:html directly. I believe the conditional import will also allow the test to import _network_image_web.dart directly and mock out the network API.\nWhen using conditional imports you need to provide both a web version and a mobile version. Since there's nothing to test for the mobile version, you can make it a noop, just an empty function that doesn't test anything (example).\nHere's a rough sketch:\n// network_image_web_test.dart\nimport '_network_image_web_io_test.dart' if (dart.library.html) '_network_image_web_test.dart';\nvoid main() {\n  runTests();\n}\n\n// _network_image_web_io_test.dart\nvoid runTests() {\n  // This is a web-specific test.

Since there's nothing to test for the mobile version, you can make it a noop, just an empty function that doesn't test anything (example).\nHere's a rough sketch:\n// network_image_web_test.dart\nimport '_network_image_web_io_test.dart' if (dart.library.html) '_network_image_web_test.dart';\nvoid main() {\n  runTests();\n}\n\n// _network_image_web_io_test.dart\nvoid runTests() {\n  // This is a web-specific test. Nothing to do for AOT engine.\n}\n\n// _network_image_web_test.dart\nvoid runTests() {\n  test('loads an image from the network', () {\n    ...\n  });\n}\n\nI've done some tests following your sketch, the headers are now correctly passed when using Flutter Web.\nI am now waiting for a review to know if I should add more tests or maybe refactor some code \ud83d\ude04",

All I want and need out of it is to be able to provide Widgets for the selected and unselected icons, as in the old/current interfaces for the destinations. Rest of it should behave as the default NavigationBar does.\nPlease consider adding an example that demonstrates how to do this, or some helper interfaces to easier accomplish it for better/easier backwards compatible API interfaces.\nMaybe I just don't fully get all the possibilities yet, but it seemed to be easier to just copy/fork the entire widget and make my own slightly modified version to do it. Mostly due to the need for the SelectableAnimatedBuilder providing animation to NavigationBarDestinationInfo that must be parent to NavigationBarDestinationBuilder.\nUse case for Widgets as Icons - Legacy lowest common interface\nI have a setup (custom widget/package) where it is possible in the API (and end user UI) to select what type of bottom navigation bar (eg Cupertino, Material, Adaptive) you want to use, and it would be nice to add MaterialYuo (NavigationBar) to it, without stepping down the API interface for its destination wrapper to IconData. This does at the moment seem to be the easy way out, but then it would all loose the Widget flexibility. Which would otherwise be the lowest common interface. This new design still feels like it will for most use cases force it down to IconData, despite the nice builder feature NavigationBar has, but as said , maybe some concrete usage example is enough.\nObservation - API Naming Consistency\nThe API naming for selected and unSelected icons seem to be a bit inconsistent between navigation control Widgets. In particular NavigationBar switches the usage of icon for selectedIcon, which typically has been used for the unselected icon or one that is just the same for both states. The table below compares some API naming differences between navigation control widgets.\nEdit 22.5.2021: Added API for selecting an item or destination to the comparison, since it was mentioned in later discussion.\n\n\n\nProperty\nNavigationBar\nNavigationRail\nBottomNavigationBar\nCupertinoTabBar\n\n\n\n\nSelected icon\nicon\nselectedIcon\nactiveIcon\nactiveIcon\n\n\nUnselected icon\nunselectedIcon\nicon\nicon\nicon\n\n\ncurrent index\nselectedIndex\nselectedIndex\ncurrentIndex\ncurrentIndex\n\n\nSelect a destination\nonTap\nonDestinationSelected\nonTap\nonTap",

This does not add any new information to the UI and is actually a bit annoying to users on desktop/web.\nThe BottomNavigationBar used to be like this too, but it was later fixed so it is now possible to remove the tooltips, or customize the tooltips via BottomNavigationBarItem to something else than just the icon label.\nBasically if you in BottomNavigationBarItem don't define a tooltip, you get the icon label, but you can remove it by specifying an empty string, or customize it to something that adds some other info than just the icon label that is already shown, if you really also want a tooltip when you are showing the labels.\nIt makes it possible to do something like this:\n        child: BottomNavigationBar(\n          items: <BottomNavigationBarItem>[\n            for (MyDestination item in destinations)\n              BottomNavigationBarItem(\n                icon: item.icon,\n                activeIcon: item.selectedIcon,\n                label: item.label,\n                tooltip: useTooltips &&\n                        item.tooltip != item.label &&\n                        item.tooltip != null\n                    ? item.tooltip\n                    : '',\n              ),\n          ],\n         ...\nWhich would only show tooltips if an \"app\" level flag to actually show tooltips is true, and if the tooltip is different from the label. Obviously in a NavigationBar equivalent destination you would also have to combine the logic with the used labelBehavior.\nUsers may then choose in settings (affecting useTooltips if tooltips are used or not in the app. Many users perceive that tooltips get in the way after you are familiar with the app.\nPlease consider some similar feature for NavigationBar to make it easier to build support for the above behavior.\nThis GIF show the tooltips showing up all the time now on Desktop/Web and there is no simple way to get rid of them.\n\nAccessibility/Legibility Design Issue\nThis is a Material design matter. However, the default NavigationBar label size using the Flutter overline text style is barely legible on Web/Desktop that use device pixel ratio 1.0.\nThis seems to be something that Material Design team may have overlooked in the design spec.\nMajority (+80% globally) of Desktop Windows and Linux PCs use a display setting that have a device pixel ratio of 1.0. Fonts with very small dp become illegible on them. The small 10dp works OK on devices with a higher device pixel ratio, like all modern phones, tablets and also most Mac desktop/laptop computers. Some Windows/Linux laptops also use device pixel ratio of 1.5 or higher, on them the default overline size of the NavigationBar works OK, but generally desktops use 1.0.\nI tried by moving the running version of the above test app over to a my laptop screen with pixel density 1.5, on that it looks OK, but not on a normal desktop screen with device pixel ratio 1.0.\nThe above GIF recording also show this. The above gif recording is from a screen with device pixel ratio 1.0. click on the GIF to open it from GitHub in native resolution and not its inline zoomed state.",

                "bodyText": "@johnsonmh Another wish, I hope NavigationBar also gets its own subtheme where you can address some of the basic customization needs.\nNow if you want to customize its look just a little bit, like making it use colorScheme.primary for the selected icon, OK if the icons are now Widgets this part became a easier, you can tweak it there, but normally that part has been preferred to be in the Widgets sub-theme so you can just set it once for your app. Plus you may want it to use colorScheme.primary with same opacity as it has for the current default colorScheme.secondary now for the highlight around the selected icon. But you can't re-use that easily, since it is hard coded. The roundness is also hard coded to border radius 20dp, maybe consider using a shape with a default stadium border if that is the design intent, and make the highlight shape customizable via a theme. The Flutter shapes have the added built-in advantage that they also animates between shape changes if it is changed, just a cool bonus.\nWhen using NavigationBar you may also want to tune the unselected icon color and labels to match that of the NavigationRail's unselected default theme icon and label color (which imo are nicer defaults than this one has now). Regardless of opinions on what is nicer looking, in a scenario where you use both NavigationRail and NavigationBar in a responsive design, you may often want their styles to match exactly. The defaults diverge quite a bit now, so you need to customize one of them quite a bit to accomplish that.\nYou may also need to customize is the label font/size, if you feel it is required for more legible labels. Having access to them via a theme would be nice.\nAs it looks now, you kind of have to build the NavigationBar up from all of its atomic builders to do most of above customizations. Doable, sure perhaps so, but imo not very fun or as easy to modify as previous approach. Not for the most common customization scenarios anyway, for  totally changing the NavigationBar into something entirely customized, the builders are a great addition of course.",

                "bodyText": "@johnsonmh I noticed another difference and minor inconsistency compared to default background with BottomNavigationBar.\nThe BottomNavigationBar's default background is when using newer color scheme based Themes ThemeData.from basing its background color on colorScheme.background via the fact that ThemeData.from assigns colorScheme.background to ThemeData.canvasColor that the default Material canvas type uses as background color.\nThis new NavigationBar on the other hand, bases its default background color on colorScheme.surface  via\nMaterial(\n      elevation: elevation,\n      color: backgroundColor ??\n          ElevationOverlay.colorWithOverlay(\n              colorScheme.surface, colorScheme.onSurface, 3.0),\nNormally when dealing with plain vanilla surface and background colors, these are of course identical. However, when building more nuanced user interfaces for a larger canvas, it is common to use a slight hint of primary color (alphaBlend) mixed into to the colorScheme.surface and/or colorScheme.background. When you go really fancy, you can use a slightly different blend strength of primary into the surface and background colors, for even more nuanced effects.\nWhen you do so, the end result is that the BottomNavigationBar and NavigationBar have backgrounds that then looks different in such designs, since they use different theme based default background colors. Perhaps this is intentional, but it might be worth considering if they should not default to the same base background color definition, it would seem more logical and again have less an impact on expected default background if you switch between them, or eg when you migrate from BottomNavigationBar to the new NavigationBar.\nHere is an example showing the difference when using such primary blended surface and background color theming in dark mode. I used a bit exaggerated difference in primary blend strength on surface and background color, than one might normally use, just to show the difference more clearly, the used example theme colors are shown too:\n\nHere it is shown as a hires GIF animation too. I also removed the double Ink ripple for this demo that @creativecreatorormaybenot mentioned:\n\nThis was just a quick experimental fix using:\nreturn NavigationBarDestinationSemantics(\n      child: NavigationBarDestinationTooltip(\n        message: label,\n        child: InkWell(\n          highlightColor: Colors.transparent,  // Hide ink effect\n          splashColor: Colors.transparent,     // Hide ink effect\n          onTap: info.onTap,\n          child: Row(\n            children: <Widget>[\n              Expanded(\n                child: NavigationBarDestinationLayout(\n                  icon: buildIcon(context),\n                  label: buildLabel(context),\n                ),\n              ),\n            ],\n          ),\n        ),\n      ),\n    );\nIt still has hover effect on desktop as before though, shown below.

                "bodyText": "Good comments @bernaferrari, here are my additions on the same topic.\n\n\nI agree, onLongPress and with that rationale also, onSecondaryPress, for opening, typically a right mouse click based context menu on desktop apps, could certainly both be useful interactions to support out of the box for other devices than phones and tablets, but perhaps it is not in the Material spec for this widget to support that, pasts ones don't do it either. Hard to say, I don't think none Googlers have the new spec for this new MaterialYou widget yet.\n\n\nThe BottomNavigationBar, that this Widget primarily replaces also uses onTap (so does the CupertinoTabBar), so from that viewpoint the current onTap is the correct choice. I added API naming comparison to my earlier table. The onPressed callback used by buttons are as far as I recall always a void callback, whereas as the onTap callbacks are ValueChanged<int>? so there is that as well. But generally sometimes it seems these call back API names are a bit varied, the NavigationRails onDestinationSelected is a good example, what was wrong with onTap for that one for consistency? These things happens in big SDKs.\n\n\nAbout tooltips, I totally agree the NavigationBar API should expose more config options without requiring constructing the thing from atoms using its builders. Tooltip labels should be possible to easily customize to something else than the navbar's text label, or completely removed. And like you say, if a default vertical offset is need (probably is due to height of this widget) that is different from Tooltip default theme vertical office, it must be available as parameter via a property, if it is hard coded like now it can't be modified even by wrapping the entire widget in its own ThemeData and custom TooltipThemeData.\n\n\n\nSome additional observations, these are just my viewpoints from playing with and using the new widget a bit. I know the design is probably written in stone by the Material Design Theme, but I'm going to throw my views out there anyway.\nHeight when labels are shown.\nIn my opinion the default height design is a bit excessive when it comes to height when labels are shown (74dp), there is room to remove a few pixels and still keeping the look balanced and nice, the size when labels are not shown, could also be tighter (it is 56dp). Old bottom nav bar is 56dp and Cupertino one is 50dp btw. However, since the API includes a height adjustment it already allows for very easy minor opinionated tweaks to this, so it honestly does not matter so much, since you can tweak it as you want it easily.\nHowever, @johnsonmh I noticed a bug, the height property currently has no impact on the height of the widget! The line:\n   final double effectiveHeight = \n      labelBehavior == NavigationBarDestinationLabelBehavior.alwaysHide\n            ? 56\n            : 74;\nshould probably be:\n   final double effectiveHeight = height ??\n        (labelBehavior == NavigationBarDestinationLabelBehavior.alwaysHide\n            ? 56\n            : 74);\nOtherwise the height property has  has no impact on the height of the NavigationBar.\nDefault label font\nThe current default font style is an odd one, the overline style has letter spacing that just looks a bit strange. Flutter 2.2 still defaults to old typography (2014), my demos use the newer \"correct\" one (2018). However, the overline style is the same with both, it is just a peculiar style choice imo, with its 1.5 letter spacing. Plus as mentioned before, due to its default small size (10dp), it is barely legible on monitors with device pixel ratio 1.0. The old BottomNavigationBar defaults are clearer, and strangely even Cupertino looks better than this, although it is also too small for device pixel ratio 1.0, but it still looks much nicer.\nLike I mentioned before, an API, perhaps via own sub-theme for the NavigationBar is needed to adjust the label text styles (maybe both selected/unselected?) easily, the sub-theme could then also include more/additional style, layout and theming properties, like e.g. custom heights for the different label style behaviors.\nBelow is an additional example showing NavigationBar, BottomNavigationBar and CupertinoTabBar on same screen.\nI applied the height fix so I could change the height of the NavigationBar, just to try how it looks at some other sizes. I tried 50dp, same as Cupertino, when not showing labels, and quite a bit tighter, 62dp when showing labels, alongside with is current default values 56 and 74. The tighter values work well enough too. But like mentioned, if it has a working version of the height property, the default can be whatever, easy enough to tweak. However, the height values should also be themeable, both values, so it is easy to theme it differently globally for an app, and not apply it to every widget, or be forced to make a custom wrapper widget for it and use that instead, just to change the height. Great that you are supposed to be able to easily adjust the height too though, this is a welcome new feature.\nThe first screen GIF recording below is at device pixel ratio 1.5. On a high res laptop screen you might have that or higher, also on devices the device pixel ratio is normally 1.5 or even much higher, at this device pixel ratio, and higher, the small fonts on NavigationBar and CupertinoTabBar are still legible and fine, although the overline font style looks odd when used here, due to its 1.5 letter spacing.\n\nHere is the same screen, but now on a normal (none Mac) desktop screen, that use the most common desktop device pixel ratio 1.0. Now the small default font size is barely legible and have poor readability and accessibility due to that.\n\n(In both cases, click on the GIFs to open them to see them at actual pixel accurate sizes).\nYou could consider the caption style instead as the default label style, if it has to have style and not just default text style with a size of 12dp. Caption uses 12dp and very similar style as default unselected label on the BottomNavigationBar, which is smaller than the default selected label on it (14dp). It would look like this, on device pixel ratio 1.0 screen, when using the newer typography 2018.\n\nIt still fits nicely, even in my smaller height examples, and this is legible on screens with device pixel ratio 1.0 as well, and the letter spacing does not look odd, like it does with the overline text style.\nWith typography 2014 there would be a bit more space between the letters, caption 2018 uses letter spacing 0.4 and 2014 is 1.0, both are 12dp.\nAs a rule of thumb, most fonts become close to illegible at 10dp if the device pixel ratio is 1.0, while 12dp is OK with most fonts, 11dp is OKish.  If the device pixel ratio is 1.5 or higher, then using font size 10dp is perfectly fine, the problem is +80% of desktops in the world use monitors that are setup to use device pixel ratio 1.0.  Since Flutter also support desktop usage, I think default font choices for widgets should also consider that they also need to work well enough and be legible on screens using device pixel ratio 1.0.\nI also drive my 2x32\" 4k home office screens at native resolution, thus at screen pixel ratio 1.0. However my 13\" touch laptop screen is 3000x2000 pixels, this one is too small to drive at such high native resolution, so here I zoom 150%, meaning the device pixel ratio is 1.5.\n\nThe discussion of too small font size (10dp) at device pixel ratio 1.0, was also earlier discussed when it comes to the default Flutter tooltip theme style, that now also uses 10dp, a size that is just too small to be legible at device pixel ratio 1.0. This was discussed and and demonstrated here #71429.\nThe Material Design team rep even seemed to agree after the demonstration that 10dp is not a very legible choice. Tooltips were 14dp before in Flutter, before it changed to 10dp. I recommended 12dp instead as default as good compromise between compact but still legible. It has however not been changed yet, so the issue is still open. It is however easy to theme the tooltip globally and correct the unfortunately too small default font size.\n\nBy the way, here is also the issue where tooltip config (other label than icon label and no tooltip at all shown) was added to the BottomNavigationBar, plus its rationale and discussion too: #71049\nThe NavigationBar is now in its current form recreating the issue that was fixed for the BottomNavigationBar, can we please not do that? \ud83d\ude03",

                "bodyText": "@johnsonmh Sorry about dropping even more comments. I was however wondering before when I tried the widget why it was getting overlay color also in light theme mode and not changing with elevation changes, not even in dark theme mode.\nAt least in the past, background overlay color has in Flutter only been applied to Material backgrounds in dark theme mode and when ambient ThemeData applyElevationOverlayColor is set to true. In this Widget you are applying overlay to both dark and light theme mode and it is not controlled by ambient theme setting for this behavior at all, as before in Flutter.\nAlso the elevation used for the elevation overlay color is hard coded to 3, and not using the actual elevation of the NavigationBar widget, so the overlay color is always constant, it does not change with elevation as it normally would in Flutter, and it is also applied to light theme mode, which is currently not the case in Flutter when using overlay color for elevation, you have this now:\nYou are using colorWithOverlay\n    return Material(\n      elevation: elevation,\n      color: backgroundColor ??\n          ElevationOverlay.colorWithOverlay(colorScheme.surface, colorScheme.onSurface, 3.0),\n      child: NavigationBarBottomPadding(\n   ...\nPerhaps this is a new standard? But more in line with current expected behavior in Flutter would be using applyOverlay:\n    return Material(\n      elevation: elevation,\n      color: backgroundColor ??\n          ElevationOverlay.applyOverlay(context, colorScheme.onSurface, elevation),\n      child: NavigationBarBottomPadding(\n   ...\nThis would use the widget elevation for applied overlay color, but only in dark theme mode, and only when the theme flag that toggles its usage is true.\nThis still gives the widget a default colorScheme.surface colored background and not the colorsScheme.Background color, like widgets of this type currently use as their background color, that they actually get from the Material's default background color.\nTo make it use the same default background and the Material dark overlay color behavior, then simply just pass the backgroundColor, it will get the Material default color if it is null or used supplied backgroundColor, and get overlay color applied based on the elevation of the Material and only in dark theme mode, and only when the flag to use it is set in ambient theme data, simply because this is already baked in behavior in Material.\n    return Material(\n      elevation: elevation,\n      color: backgroundColor,\n      child: NavigationBarBottomPadding(\n   ...\nStill of course, it all depends on what the new Material You design specs are, but it seems a bit off that it would deviate this much from past designs, when it comes to elevation, if that is the case pretty much all past widgets in Flutter will need to be rewritten or replaced with new ones to accommodate MaterialYou color scheme behavior.\nAnyway, I just though I would mention this since it deviated quite radically from past Flutter SDK background color and elevation behavior.",

Probably together with a number of other new MaterialYou related updates that Flutter will need in order to support MaterialYou that is introduced with Android12.\nIf not, there will indeed be a big rush to release Anroid12 related MaterialYou widgets and features in Flutter when Android12 is released. So I'm pretty sure Flutter - Android - Material teams are collaborating on including support for MaterialYou in a way that will try to match the release of Android12, if possible. This way Flutter applications can also migrate and use new MaterialYou design features after Abdroid12 is released. Sure it would of course be nice to have them before Android12 is released so that we could also prepare Flutter apps that use the new Material design features in advance too. However, I have not noticed them in master channel yet, although I must admit I have not spent so much time on master channel recently.\nI know that the above feedback has been received and reviewed by the Material design team, but I guess we will have to wait and see what the result is until it is released.\ncc: @willlarche",

Oh, I like the idea with both text labels and optional widget, used it for some custom widgets for similar as mentioned reasons too.\nEven if this is a new Material v3 widget, I think it is important that it fits and uses conventions that matches how Flutter widgets currently behave, whenever that is appropriate and may be reasonably expected.

Therefore #12992 would rarely have an impact.\nAnd even in the event where it does have an impact, then there's a simple workaround to that specific issue.\nInstead of:\nif (foo) {\n  return Text(Foo.of(context));\n} else {\n  return Text(Bar.of(context));\n}\nwe can have:\nif (foo) {\n  return Builder(\n    key: const Key('foo'),\n    builder: (context) => Text(Foo.of(context)),\n  );\n} else {\n  return Builder(\n    key: const Key('bar'),\n    builder: (context) => Text(Bar.of(context)),\n  );\n}",

I think this is a breaking change and it should be discussed. Theoretically, I think we can make this new kotlin version work with AGP 3.3.0 by asking the compiler to ignore the differences in metadata versions (which is what it complains about) - but I haven't tried this yet, might not work ok and seems like a temp solution.

That is, one shipped as a\n plugin that requires the changes to the app you are suggesting, and one\n with a default (no-op) implementation.\n\n \u2014\n You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n <#89511 (comment)>,\n or unsubscribe\n <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAKWJPQRZB6OHKQXIMVJTGLUEYET5ANCNFSM5DPB76AA>\n .\n Triage notifications on the go with GitHub Mobile for iOS\n <https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1477376905?ct=notification-email&mt=8&pt=524675>\n or Android\n <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.android&referrer=utm_campaign%3Dnotification-email%26utm_medium%3Demail%26utm_source%3Dgithub>.",

I'm not sure why you're asking, but I hope that answers your question. The only doc we have so far is the one you linked to earlier in this thread.\nI understand the issues devs will face by changing the compileSdkVersion, but as I understand it, androidX already moved all their libraries to require a min compile sdk version of 31 (including any androidX library flutter already uses and will have to update at some point). Staying on api 30 is a temporary solution.\nIn fact, not using compile version 31, while using libraries compiled with it is dangerous, as parts of the code might get obfuscated / removed during the build process. To my understanding, that is why androidX specifically added the minCompileSdk to all their libraries.\nOn the other hand, my concern with the proposed solution is that devs might end up using display features without them actually working. Devs might expect dialogs and popups to avoid the hinge, but without opting in, that will not happen, and they will not be aware of it.",

                "bodyText": "Thank you for the PR and great work! Left some initial feedback and questions.\nAn additional question regarding the UIIndirectScribbleInteractionDelegate protocol:\nwhen does UIKit call func indirectScribbleInteraction(UIInteraction, frameForElement: Self.ElementIdentifier) -> CGRect? Is it always immediately after one of the async calls (func indirectScribbleInteraction(UIInteraction, requestElementsIn: CGRect, completion: ([Self.ElementIdentifier]) -> Void) or func indirectScribbleInteraction(UIInteraction, focusElementIfNeeded: Self.ElementIdentifier, referencePoint: CGPoint, completion: ((UIResponder & UITextInput)?) -> Void))? I'd like to understand how much information we would have to send to the engine every frame.\n\nI believe UIKit calls func indirectScribbleInteraction(UIInteraction, requestElementsIn: CGRect, completion: ([Self.ElementIdentifier]) -> Void) and waits for the completion handler. Then it calls func indirectScribbleInteraction(UIInteraction, frameForElement: Self.ElementIdentifier) -> CGRect. Since I have func indirectScribbleInteraction(UIInteraction, shouldDelayFocusForElement: Self.ElementIdentifier) -> Bool always returning true, it waits for a pause in the user input before calling func indirectScribbleInteraction(_ interaction: UIInteraction, focusElementIfNeeded elementIdentifier: Self.ElementIdentifier, referencePoint focusReferencePoint: CGPoint, completion: @escaping ((UIResponder & UITextInput)?) -> Void)\nI don't think we're sending info to the engine on every frame during the indirect interaction now that I moved that to the framework side. Once the input is focused, we do calculate the selection boxes every frame, but we also cache those on the framework side so that they only actually get sent to the engine when changed.",

PencilKit uses those to accomplish the Insert scribble method where you can long press with the pencil to get some extra space to write in.\nLet me know your thoughts there.

Also, while I'm happy with the current approach in the change, I can't help but (re)ask some questions.\nThis change will deprecate the AssetBundle.loadStructuredData API, replacing it with a more general form that operates directly on ByteData, loadStructuredDataBinary. If we are OK with deprecating loadStructuredData, I can't help but think about how loadStructuredData might be currently used and whether or not it should have ever been exposed to begin with. As I understand it, the primary intent of loadString and loadStructuredData is to provide built-in caching of string and structured data (e.g. JSON) assets respectively (loadString also conveniently provides UTF-8 decoding). The idea to me, then, is if there are disparate codebases that access the same (text/structured data) asset, then the app will benefit from caching. I still am not sure about the idea (how often are disparate codebases requesting text/JSON assets?), but changing it now could risk unexpected performance degradation for not much gain, so I don't think it's worth worrying about now.\nCaching aside, outside of the tool itself, is there a known use case of loadStructuredData aside from reading the asset manifest (e.g. google fonts for figuring it out if it can avoid loading fonts over the network because they are already available)?\n\nIf there is no such use case, would the google fonts use case be better as something we explicitly support with additional APIs (e.g. an API that determines whether or not a font with a particular name is available)? I ask this because the idea of external code loading and inspecting AssetManifest.json directly feels like reverse-engineering. If we plan to deprecate loadStructuredData and thus break that means of accessing AssetManifest.json, then, I feel like, while we are at it, we may as well improve the API here so folks don't have to reach into flutter internals like AssetManifest.json (or AssetManifest.bin).\nIf there is such a use case, then do we really want to deprecate loadStructuredData? If folks, for example, want to include JSON (or similar) files as assets, then why inconvenience them by having them switch to loadStructuredDataBinary and then prepend UTF8 decoding into their parser function? Why not just keep both APIs around?",

When the sample point in the image falls exactly at an integer, that is right between two image pixels, we can now round differently than previously. However, the change only affects the software rasterizer used in flutter_tester. The behavior on actual GPUs when sampling exactly between two pixels of an image is unspecified and can vary GPU to GPU and therefore can't be relied on. So I'd recommend switching to FilterQuality low rather than none.",

The goal here is to move the DAP implementation from Dart-Code's TypeScript codebase into the SDKs (where it can be used more easily by other tools/editors, as well as the VS Code extension). The first job is to make it do everything that that current Dart-Code DAP does so VS Code can switch to it.\nI'm not sure what \"auto attach to process\" means though. We should support attaching to running apps (by having the DAP call flutter attach) although it's done not yet. I'm not sure if you'd be able to attach to tests though - Flutter would need to support that, but also the JSON reporter would have already emitted some events if it was started externally, which might prevent things working correctly.\nCan you describe what you're trying to do (and why just running the tests directly through the DAP wouldn't be enough?).\n(Note: flutter test support is not included in this PR, but I do have ready for a follow-up PR after this lands.. it will be started as flutter debug-adapter --test).",

                "bodyText": "@rrousselGit ah, gotcha. Unfortunately not. I believe the way that works in nodejs is that VS Code is monitors the terminals for node processes and can attach to them directly. For Dart, we need to know the VM Service URI (including its authentication token) which we can't discover ourselves. We'd also need the user to run the app with special flags (to enable the VM Service).\nWe could support manually attaching to tests, but you wouldn't get the test-specific functionality (since we won't have a complete view of the JSON).\nGenerally, I would recommend launching tests from within VS Code normally and not through the terminal, as there's just a lot of functionality we can't support if we don't control the tool process that's spawned.\n\nflutter debug_adapter --test\n\nTo be clear - flutter debug-adapter is intended to be run by tools/editors, not users. It starts a service that expects you to talk with JSON (similar to flutter daemon and flutter run --machine) - although since the client speaks first it will produce no initial output.\nIt would be useful to you if you're building an editor/editor integration, trying to configure an editor with a generic DAP client (where there isn't a specific Dart/Flutter extension to do this for you and need to tell it how to start the debug adapter), or some other tool where you want to run and interact with Dart/Flutter programs/tests programatically and would prefer to use a more generic standard than launching and using the VM Service.\nFWIW, I did previously ask VS Code about having an API where we could intercept a user running dart or flutter from the terminal, and launch a proper debug session from it, but it didn't like something that was likely to happen (probably for a whole host of reasons!).",

This new package would only contain Fuchsia-specific parts (How to talk to a Fuchsia device over USB and SSH. How to track the lifecycle of processes/stories/mods running in Fuchsia. How to enable/disable the driver extension inside a Flutter app running on Fuchsia.). One way to look at it is this is \"adb for Fuchsia\". It can indeed be imported and used independently of flutter_driver and flutter_tools (perhaps the Fuchsia infra team can use it for some testing). I still think that this package should live over in the Fuchsia source (similar to how adb is developed as part of the Android SDK), and managed and tested using Fuchsia infra (jiri and so on). But I failed to convince the Fuchsia team to do this. Developing it as part of Flutter but as a standalone package seemed like a good compromise.",

For three shapes, you need three lerp functions.  For five, you need ten. If we had 32 shapes, we'd need 496 lerp functions. (x = n(n-1)/2). We don't have to support every lerp, but the more the better.

The problem is that adding a new shape is exponential in the number of lerps you need to implement, since not only does this have to lerp to, say, rectangle, rectangle needs to lerp to it. For three shapes, you need three lerp functions. For five, you need ten. If we had 32 shapes, we'd need 496 lerp functions. (x = n(n-1)/2).\n\nIt's actually a bit more complicated than that, because some of the lerps actually generate new (otherwise inaccessible) types, which you then need to be able to lerp to/from. For example, _CompoundBorder, _RoundedRectangleToCircleBorder, _StadiumToRoundedRectangleBorder, etc. And do we need to support lerping from a _RoundedRectangleToCircleBorder to a _StadiumToRoundedRectangleBorder? How would we even implement that without making at least one public. :-)",

Just am super busy with the holiday season right now. And previously, with working on updates to a different part of the app that uses this custom code. I know @tneotia updated our code, I just need to test setting custom MIME Types so users can select which they want to handle (vs. just automatically handling every type). I would like to do it by the end of the year.\nIf no one sees an update by me nearing Christmas, give me a ping and I'll try to get on it :)",

It takes a List<String> and allows you to \"whitelist\" MIME Types for any content that is committed by your keyboard. Currently, if you do not provide a list (i.e. it's null), but provide a callback for onContentCommitted, it will show a toast error when you try and commit content because you did not pass any MIME Types. I've been speaking it over with @tneotia, and we decided that we may want a default list of MIME Types to be automatically supported if contentCommitMimeTypes is null. Here are the use-cases, which I will need to verify (and probably make changes for):\n1. onContentCommitted callback is null, show error toast (mime types null) on content committed\n2. onContentCommitted callback provided but custom mime types null, automatically assume a default list of supported MIME types\n3. onContentCommitted callback provided and custom mime types provided, use custom types and show toast if the mime type of inserted content doesn't match\n\nDoes anyone have any issues with auto automatically enabling a default set of MIME Types to be supported if contentCommitMimeTypes is null? If you guys think we should leave it as is and make it show an error toast if no MIME Types are provided (i.e. you have to specify them manually), please chime in.\nThanks!",

On the other PR you mentioned imperative vs declarative - but I think the big issue in this PR is the monolith problem. A pattern that we've seen, which continues here, is treating these core text APIs as a dumping ground for anything and everything that any platform can do. I think it's clear that the logical conclusion for this pattern of behavior is that TextInputConfiguration, TextInputClient and TextInputConnection will eventually hold every setting and every method that exists across Android, iOS, Mac, Windows, Linux, and Web. There's no obvious alternative path with the way things are going.\nCombine this API direction with the fact that these APIs are unavoidable, and we have a big problem. Developers can't escape the monolith, so creating a monolith is very harmful. I do think that the monolith problem should be addressed ASAP, and any such platform-specific behavior should be paused until Flutter can find a reasonable API structure that decomposes in a reasonable way.\nIf you'd like to assemble the Text Working Group for some brainstorming, I'll make myself available.",

So if you just add more MIME Types, it can support more than just images. However, I haven't tested that to the full extend. I'd need to find a keyboard that can commit that other type of content. I'll be honest, I don't think I'll personally be able to test that too in depth",

Sending rich image content from the platform keyboard requires TextInputClient's input connection.

So you'd have to add simctl code to your dart test as setup (this needs to be exec'd in dart, but I just tested this in bash as an example)\n$ xcrun simctl create \"TestFlutterWatch\" \"Apple Watch Series 5 - 44mm\" \n709E9D7C-5D9D-4753-8423-F3BB7515E6FB\n$ xcrun simctl create \"TestFlutteriPhoneWithWatch\" \"iPhone 11\"\n375D81C8-0EB4-4CFF-A14F-1066C9B85EED\n$ xcrun simctl pair 709E9D7C-5D9D-4753-8423-F3BB7515E6FB 375D81C8-0EB4-4CFF-A14F-1066C9B85EED\n2360C20E-86EC-454C-8BF2-9053AD6AAE93\n\n      await inDirectory(watchApp, () async {\n        await flutter(\n          'build',\n          options: <String>[\n         'ios',\n          '--no-codesign',\n          '-d',\n          '2360C20E-86EC-454C-8BF2-9053AD6AAE93',\n          ],\n        );\n      });\nThen needs to be cleaned up in a finally:\n$ xcrun simctl delete 375D81C8-0EB4-4CFF-A14F-1066C9B85EED\n$ xcrun simctl delete 709E9D7C-5D9D-4753-8423-F3BB7515E6FB\n\nTo be tested like:\n$ cd dev/devicelab\n$ dart bin/run.dart -t app_with_watch_companion\n\nThen added to \n  \n    \n      flutter/dev/bots/test.dart\n    \n    \n         Line 939\n      in\n      3411129\n    \n  \n  \n    \n\n        \n          \n           if (Platform.isMacOS) () => _runDevicelabTest('plugin_lint_mac'), \n        \n    \n  \n\n\nif (Platform.isMacOS) () => _runDevicelabTest('app_with_watch_companion'),\n(And you can see why I haven't gotten around to fixing this yet \ud83d\ude04).\n\n\n\n\nFor some reason this leads to TARGET_BUILD_DIR always ending in 'iphoneos' even though the actual directory will end with 'iphonesimulator' for simulator builds.\n\nThis is very concerning, and I saw this in my own tests, too I'm not sure what other issues this will cause.",

Updating all the pubspecs should be done in a separate PR (and eventually automatically).\n\nYes, have already tried that, but this leads to analyze-linux failing due to a dependency conflict for the path package.  The obvious next step is to manually edit the version number of the autogenerated dependency so that it matches the version used by the reverted pubspec files. Unsurprisingly this yields a checksum error for the pubsec file. Furthermore removing the checksum then results in analyze-linux not detecting the autogenerated imports and the error from the beginning asking for a forced package upgrade. :-( Kudos for the very solid checks btw. ;-)\nSo I was thinking about creating the checksum by hand to finally convince the analyze script, but somehow it didn't feel like this would be the intended way to handle this error.

MaterialPageRoutes fade in/out, but will scale and translate when a modal sheet route appears.\nCupertinoPageRoutes animate from left to right, but should scale and translate when a modal sheet route appears.",

Also, I could be wrong about this given more data. I might not be making a complete observation here either. Since Apple's APIs are evolving as well, rather than freezing in Apple's current implementation, we have to map their APIs into our APIs' intents as well and some of which will be a subjective call.\nTo me, the main differentiation we need to make between the modal pop-over style APIs we have such as showModalBottomSheet, showCupertinoModalPopup etc and the \"permanent\" page style APIs such as PageRoute with CupertinoFullscreenDialogTransition is how transient, non-resting-state the page in question are.\nRegarding https://fluffy.es/facebook-draggable-bottom-card-modal-1/ and the current dialogs, Cupertino action sheets etc, despite visual similarities, I believe they serve very different purposes than iOS 13's modal sheets. Consider, for instance, this sequence of actions:\n\nWhile modal (i.e. you need to stay here or in a child page until you complete the task), they're not lightweight, ephemeral or leaf nodes in the navigation. They need to deeply integrate with the rest of our PageRoutes (seen by the horizontal style transition in the middle of the existing vertical sheet transation) #33799. An equivalent question to ask is can a dialog itself be in the middle of a sequence of navigations that subsequently lead into another fullscreen page on top of it.\nRegarding navigator 2.0, another distinguishing question we can ask ourselves is could users deep link into one of the sheet presented pages and could a sheet presented page be serialized along with the rest of the navigation stack and then restored? I think the answer for both questions are no for a dialog box or a Cupertino action sheet and yes for a modal sheet.",

I agree with you that the iOS modal is not as ephemeral as the modal bottom sheet described in the material guidelines. iOS Sheet Modals should be able to display it with a deep link and allow inside-navigation. Related to the last one, I think users should use a nested Navigator or a  CupertinoTabView. On iOS, UINavigationController it is used with the same idea (ref).\nOne of my concerns is that, on iOS,  I haven't seen a case where a different 'PageRoute/UIViewController' can push from a modal page. I don't think it is possible on iOS, but it would be possible on Flutter just by pushing a new route to the Navigator.\nI implemented the same API as the showModalBottomSheet as they have a lot of similarities, but I agree that should be exposed as a Route and not as a static API.\nBut for me, there is a blurred line between the material modal bottom sheet and the iOS modal sheet page.  There are some edge examples I have been researching:\n\n Modal Sheets examples \n\n\nApple Home App. Official iOS Modal Page.\nThe same case happens on Spotify\nModal sheet don't animate the previous route\n \n\n\nApple Store App. Official iOS Modal Page. iPad Version\nThe modal page on the iPad is displayed as dialog animated from the bottom. No code changes from the iPhone modal version.\n\n\n \n\niOS Share Sheet\nCan be expanded as a full modal page. Can have nested modals.\n\n \n\n**Material Modal Bottom Sheet **\n\nThe initial vertical position is capped at 50% of the screen height.(\u274c Different)\nExpandable full screen.\nThe concept is limited to simple actions. For other uses, material recommends Expanding Bottom Sheet that animate from a view instead of from the bottom.\nhttps://material.io/develop/android/components/bottom-sheet-dialog-fragment says they are thew new version of dialogs\n \n\nFacebook App. Custom Modal Bottom Sheet.\n\nIt has nested modals. And the models can have inside the navigation.  They are expanded or custom height. Could they be deep linked?\n \n\nSlack Modal Bottom Sheet https://github.com/slackhq/PanModal\nThey can be expanded, nested, and have inside navigation. They could also be deep linked.\n\n \n\nIn the examples, for me, they share the same concepts and use different appearances to be displayed. All are animated from the bottom, can be closed by dragging, can be fit/expanded, and if there is a scroll view both scroll and drag should be sync. They can also be nested and used inside the navigation.\nMaybe the naming is not the same but the implementation is. I understand that we should prioritize the material modal_bottom_sheet concept just for actions and use another name for the rest.\nUPDATE: This is how it is used in Swift UI. Just calls it sheet\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view-presentation\nstruct ContentView: View {\n    @State var showingDetail = false\n\n    var body: some View {\n        Button(action: {\n            self.showingDetail.toggle()\n        }) {\n            Text(\"Show Detail\")\n        }.sheet(isPresented: $showingDetail) {\n            DetailView()\n        }\n    }\n}\nSo what about calling it CupertinoSheetRoute? And it would extend SheetRoute that can be used to display these kinds of pages that appear from the bottom?\nFor Navigator 2.0 would be CupertinoSheetPage then",

Is this related to #33799 or something else? Maybe you meant whether it's possible to push something not nested into the modal sheet but overtop it? If so I agree.\n\nApple Home App. Official iOS Modal Page.\n\nUmm weird, it does animate the bottom page for me. Might be a bug.\n\nApple Store App. Official iOS Modal Page. iPad Version\n\nThis is a great example. I was just thinking we might be able to make the optimization in case of modal sheets to turn the bottom route offscreen. This example definitely makes the case for it. While we don't currently support tablet formats (such as context menus instead of action sheets etc), we should definitely design architecturally with that in mind.\n\niOS Share Sheet\n\nGreat example too. I think the learning from that one is snapping at the 50% position will need to be something we leave room for as well.

While DraggableScrollableSheet you can drag anywhere from a min to max position, this widget should auto-snap to the min, max, or somewhere in the middle position.\nWe can make this class Sheet private and use only it in SheetRoute or adapt it so it can be also used outside the route (like DraggableScrollableSheet). If the name is not descriptive enough we could be named it SnapSheet.\nIf we do that, this would allow also an easier implementation of these complex interactions:\n\nSnap sheet demos: Apple Stocks, Google Maps\n\n\n\n\nA thing that still need to be considered out: To sync a ScrollView with the Sheet you need to use the same scrollController:\nRight now there is two options to do this:\nCupertinoSheetRoute(\n   builder: (context) => SingleChildScrollView(\n      primary: true,\n      child: Container(),\n    ),\n),\nor\nCupertinoSheetRoute(\n   builder: (context) => SingleChildScrollView(\n      controller: SheetController.of(context).scrollController,\n      child: Container(),\n    ),\n),\nI prefer the first one but I think people will have problems with it because of this: #64236. Using Scaffold inside the SheetRoute would make this non-usable, eg:\nCupertinoSheetRoute(\n   builder: (context) => Scaffold(\n     body: Builder(\n       builder: (context) => SingleChildScrollView(\n           primary: true,\n           child: Container(),\n        ),\n     ),\n   ),\n),\n26/10 Update Made some progress with the snapping capability, still need to integrate it with previous features (eg. bouncing, and curves)\n\n CupertinoSheetRoute(\n       initialStop: 0.5,\n       stops: [0, 0.5, 1]\n       builder: (context) => Container(),\n ),",

And will take another look.\n\nSo you're saying fork at the ModalRoute level and let there be a PageRoute, SheetRoute and PopupRoute as options? Without looking too deeply into the framework for existing assumptions and usages of PageRoute that are already baked into the framework, that sounds reasonable to me. @goderbauer might have some opinions on creating a branch there too (also wrt navigator 2.0).\n\nHow do PageRoute and SheetRoute interact with each other? My understanding from iOS is that once you have pushed a sheet, you can push other routes within that sheet as well. What are those routes within the sheet? Do I need a separate Navigator for those in the sheet and then push regular PageRoutes onto them? Can I just push other SheetRoutes and PageRoutes and they will show up within the sheet? While on a sheet can I push another sheet? I think to decide whether a SheetRoute makes sense as a parallel concept to PageRoute I need to better understand how those two are supposed to interact with each other.\nThese questions also extend to Navigator 2.0. If I have a CupertinoSheetPage in my list of pages and the next page is a CupertinoPage, will it fully cover the SheetPage? (is that event legal in the cupertino design language?) Or will it somehow show up within the SheetPage?\nAs general feedback: It would be good to make it a little clearer what the entry point for the API is. Reading through the code it wasn't clear to me what is part of the public API and what isn't really. Better documentation would also help with figuring out how the pieces fit together.",

                "bodyText": "Ok, After re-reading the comment thread and talking to @xster I have a better understanding of this subject:\nI agree that the iOS sheet should behave more like a route and less like a modal. It is more permanent than a modal and it may include other \"screens\" (see for example the calendar editing flow). Given that, I think there should be something you push actively on the Navigator to show the sheet. This could be a special SheetRoute (which my include a sub-navigator to present other PageRoutes within the sheet - we should consider whether certain SheetRoute types always add a sub-navigator to achieve this since it seems pretty common and I think it doesn't make much sense to push a full-screen PageRoute over a SheetRoute?).\nThe more interesting aspect is still how PageRoutes and SheetRoutes will interact with each other. The most difficult part here seems to be that the new route needs to tell the old route how to transition off screen. That's something our routing system doesn't currently support, AFAIK. It may make sense to design this mechanism first. I think it should be a general mechanism of Routes, that's not specific to cupertino routes.\nSo, to answer the original question:\n\nSo you're saying fork at the ModalRoute level and let there be a PageRoute, SheetRoute and PopupRoute as options? Without looking too deeply into the framework for existing assumptions and usages of PageRoute that are already baked into the framework, that sounds reasonable to me. @goderbauer might have some opinions on creating a branch there too (also wrt navigator 2.0).\n\nI am not opposed to adding a new SheetRoute route type.",

Instead we should fix it right away. Rerun a flaky test until it passes seems to be better than ignoring it as flaky until someone really breaks it without anyone noticing it.\nFor example, our framework Cirrus tests are famously known to be flaky. But marking it as flaky and ignoring its result doesn't seem to be the correct thing to do. I'd rather rerun the Cirrus tests, or just fix its flakiness.",

The age of the test isn't necessarily correlated with that.\n\nThis is my take on the matter. If a test is failing because we broke the product then it should be blocking. If a test is failing because it was not set up to be reliable then the problem is on the test, not on the new fixes that are trying to land while it is poorly written. Finally, if a test is flaky because the hardware or infra environment is not set up well for it - a similar evaluation to the test being wrong, but a different person responsible to fix it.\nAlso, if a test is flaky then the onus should be on the person who wants the test evaluated to fix it. Leaving it as blocking lets them be lax about getting around to diagnosing and fixing the test. Marking it as flaky means it is on them to fix it and get it back into a state where it is reasonable to expect other people to halt their work if it fails.\nI don't think a poorly written test, for example and I count a test that doesn't work well in the test environment as some form of \"poorly written\", should block work from developers who are trying to move the product forward. That's all on the test writer or owner to deal with.",

We don't have enough capacity as it is. We can't waste it on bad tests.\nIt makes the dashboard look red when it's green. This is a morale issue as well as just generally confusing.\nIt reduces confidence in tests in general.\nWorst of all, it creates a culture of ignoring tests that fail because \"just mark it flaky\".\n\nWe have had numerous tests recently fail legitimately that we just ignore because the failure is not reported 100% of the time, it's 90% failing, or 50% failing. These are not passing tests that erroneously fail, they are failing tests that erroneously pass. THEY SHOULD CLOSE THE TREE UNTIL WE FIX THEM. They should not be causing us to mark them flaky.",

If so (that wasn't clear to me), then this conceptually seems fine, though it'll require a rollout that doesn't break the dashboard.  flutter/cocoon#406 would cause the GetStatus endpoint to start using the \"New\" key instead of \"Flaky\", which would break the AngularDart frontend.  The rollout should allow for an overlap where forwards-compatible changes can be made to Cocoon, then this change landed, then cleanup can be made on the Cocoon side (so we don't leave technical debt behind of referring to these as flaky in one place and new in another).  Hence my comments in #39856 (review) and #39856 (comment).\nMy thought is that there's likely to be a lot of changes made to Cocoon once we're fully migrated to Dart, since there's a lot of low hanging fruit there - and that it's better to wait until we're doing that.",

The problem we've run into so far is that Jetifier doesn't work with how we build Flutter apps and include plugins: #32714. You can see this by making a new template with this PR or by migrating an app manually, then depending on a an older plugin (like firebase_core: 0.1.0), then running flutter build apk.\nEven with Jetifier being broken for us @dnfield I think this is probably an improvement. At least all of flutter/plugins are migrated to AndroidX at this point, so with that it makes sense to me to have the default template be migrated too. Right now people still need to migrate manually.",

I know for sure if I test doing this kind of thing with drawText, it works as @sir-boformer describes.\nI think exposing drawText would have to be handled as a separate issue if it really is desirable - I agree that it might be nice for cases where you don't want to do line breaking and complicated layout/style run logic.

So for example, for the first one, you now get a  MAP_VALUE_TYPE_NOT_ASSIGNABLE.\nUnfortunately, you guys have been filtering based on that general STRONG_MODE_STATIC_TYPE_ERROR.\nAll of these except the 5th and the last error fall under the general category of issues that we identified in the Flutter Strong Mode doc as something that we'd like to have a way to support, but we don't converged on a language level solution yet.\nFor the callback cases, you can avoid the error by making the cast local:\n     gestures: <Type, GestureRecognizerFactory>{\n        ImmediateMultiDragGestureRecognizer: (GestureRecognizer _recognizer) {\n         ImmediateMultiDragGestureRecognizer recognizer = _recognizer; \n          return (recognizer ??= new ImmediateMultiDragGestureRecognizer())\n            ..onStart = _handleOnStart;\n        }\n      },\nThis is essentially the code that we would most likely end up having the compiler generate for you if we supported this pattern.",

You can put a cast in there for now, but at least the fifth one will eventually start failing when the language moves to 2.0.  Using a Map<dynamic, dynamic> where a Map<String, List<String>> is expected breaks all of the assumptions that strong mode is trying to enforce to make AOT better.\nThe second and third errors I could look into providing some experimental support for.  Not sure whether that fits your timeline for rolling, but I don't think it would take me too long to implement that.  Alternatively you can cast them, which will work for now.\nA solution for the rest of the errors are probably a bit more work, and it's not clear that a solution that we put in now will be the final solution.  @jmesserly has started experimental work on supporting covariant overrides, and I have proposed to use a similar mechanism for these cases: basically you would annotate the parameter and the compiler would automatically generate the code that I wrote above.  It's possible that we could get something out the door for you guys to prototype in a week or two, but in the meantime you would either need to work around it using the pattern that I wrote above, or else by suppressing the individual errors in some way.",

A couple of things we should be clear on though, to be sure that we're on the same page.\n\n\nThis is not a strong mode breaking change. This is Flutter relying on an implementation detail of the analyzer error codes in order to suppress existing error messages.  Implementation details like that are not part of the public API, and can and will change.  I am happy to work with the Flutter team to try to accommodate their needs, but we cannot maintain anything close to the kind of velocity that we need to have if we have to run any change to our implementation by the Flutter team, and revert any change that touches on Flutter.\n\n\nStrong mode has made, and will continue in the future to make, actual breaking changes as we move towards Dart 2.0.  Some of these breaking changes will affect Flutter, just as they currently affect large numbers of other users inside of google.  Sometimes those breaking changes will require changes to user code.  Sometimes the feedback we get from those breaking changes will lead us to back out of, or change our approach to, the breaking change.  None of this process is instantaneous, and if you are committed to rolling in new versions of strong mode frequently, you will certainly have to change code occasionally (hopefully usually for the better), and it is highly likely that you will sometimes need to work around issues.

For example, the .analysis_options file is discussed extensively in https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/analyzer.\n\nThe use of that file to refer to specific error codes is, as far as I know, undocumented.  I'll defer to @pq and @bwilkerson as to whether or not that feature is considered part of the stable API or not.  I sincerely hope not, since I think it's very bad for the analyzer in general if changing an internal error code is a breaking change, but again, I'll defer to them.\nFor the specific case of strong mode, this is definitely an area that we will make changes in.   I basically don't care too much to argue over whether those changes are considered breaking or not.  To provide concrete context: the error code that you were relying on was a catch-all error code for a bunch of errors that we emitted in a separate pass that we tacked on to the analyzer. That catch-all category happened to include mostly things that you wanted to ignore (plus a small number of errors that you didn't really want to ignore and which were hence collateral damage).  That pass is in the process of going away for the sake of code health, performance, and improved user experience.  We are now emitting better, more precise error messages, and we have less duplicated code.  This is an important part of us moving strong mode forward and integrating it into the language.\nI understand that this is causing you some pain here, since you were relying on that organization of the errors for your filtering, and I'm willing to work with you to get to a good resolution.  I'm not in general ruling out temporarily reverting changes pending a resolution, but I will only do that very reluctantly - it has a very bad effect on our velocity, and our willingness to make changes in general.  This is particularly true if, as I understand is the case, Flutter is proposing to roll weekly.\nIn this particular case, I see a small number of errors, a few of which are things which you will at some point have to address (and can fix for now with casts), and the rest of which are things that we are working on at the language level.  The latter cases are, I believe, in non-API facing code where a small temporary work-around will address the issue pending a resolution.  I would suggest that the simplest and fastest solution would be to modify your code as I've suggested, with a TODO referencing the language changes.  Feel free to file a language bug and assign it to me.  I can commit to prioritizing getting you a prototype solution, but a final solution with syntax depends on buy in from the full language team.\nIt's also possible that @pq can suggest an alternative path to enabling you guys to just ignore these errors - I know there are a number of paths to doing so in the analyzer currently, but I don't know how all of these play into the Flutter story.",

Then we land that, flip the flag in any customer code, make the tests pass, then we flip the default for the flag and remove the old behaviour, land that, remove the flag flip in the customer code, and then finally remove the flag. Ideally if we do this we'd also publish a migration guide, which for this kind of change would be really trivial, just telling people there's nothing to change, all we've done is make the colors better, and pointing them to the properties they can use to control the colors if they prefer the old styles.",

It's the only thing that uses FocusAttachment other than Focus, and it would be better if we could just say that all focus operations should use a Focus widget, in order to centralize the code for that. It will also require some reworking of things, since it'll have to discover the focus node from the Focus widget (via Focus.of(context)) and pass it down to the render object, but I think it would be a good idea. That might also help with this problem, to pull some of the focus stuff out of editable text.",

The key function I would like to see tested is _labelStyle, since it accepts an index and merges that with the user's progress through the stepper and the Dark Mode / Light Mode status before ultimately yielding a TextStyle. The internals of that function are pretty complicated, so I think we should have tests to verify that a Stepper with X steps, and currently at step Y, is rendering each label correctly. There are a few scenarios to cover there - steps before, on, and after the active step; in both light mode and dark mode.\nDoes all of that make sense?\nPS - I promise not to disappear this time!",

When you access a list item, the CPU L1/L2 cache will fetch adjacent memory which likely covers the next few items. Hence visiting the next item will be a CPU L1/L2 cache hit which is much faster than accessing the main memory.\nA LinkedList puts adjacent item in random locations. Accessing an item is unlikely to fetch adjacent items into CPU L1/L2 cache. Hence visiting adjacent items will be slower due to cache miss, but it has a better asymptotic complexity when items can be inserted/removed at random locations. A List takes O(N) time to do that while a LinkedList takes O(1) time to do that.\n\nOf course, one can implement a custom HybridList which links smaller continuous List together to utilize CPU L1/L2 cache for adjacent items, and limit worst case complexity by limiting the smaller List to have a constant size.\nThat may be an over-optimization unless we can prove that piece of code is actually a bottleneck in real applications. That said, I'm Ok with both the List and LinkedList approach since I haven't seen any related performance issues in real applications yet. Even the O(N^2) vs O(N) worst case complexity doesn't bother me too much as I expect N to be quite small (<10) in most cases. For example, the standard quick sort algorithm in C++ uses O(N^2) sorting algorithm instead of O(N log N) algorithm for small N.\nIn summary, if it's me, I'll just pick the one that's easiest to implement and read, until I see a performance issue in a real app.",

This test breaks on master and passes on your PR.\nHowever, I did find a bug (unrelated to this PR) that causes the header to disappear on mouse move, which I've filed at #51152. This bug seems to occur only when the text is not wrapped in the InkWell (which is only found out thanks to your PR), so until that issue is fixed, you'll need to wrap the header in InkWell unconditionally.\nHopefully this is a good starting point for you!",

The current structure can roughly be presented as:\ntableCell = Container(\n  child: Row(\n    children: [\n      label,  // The `label` argument of `DataColumn`\n      if (onSort != null) sortingArrow,\n    ],\n  ),\n);\nImagine the cell is 100px wide, the arrow being 10px wide and the text 40 px wide. You would expect that:\n\nIf label: Text('Cities') the text is at the left edge of the cell, i.e. [0, 40]\nIf label: Center(child: Text('Cities')) the text is at the center of the cell, [30, 70]\n\n\nThis wouldn't directly work because Row prefers the minimum size, but you can fix it by wrapping it with an Expand.\n\n\nIf label: Align(alignment: Alignment.centerRight), child: Text('Cities')) the text is at the right edge of the possible space, i.e. [50, 90]. (You'll also need Expand).\n\nApparently No. 2 wouldn't center the text in the cell with the current implementation, because the text will be at the center of the remaining space, which is [25, 65].\nAlright, what if we add a mirroring padding at the left, so that since we know the arrow is 10px wide, make the text centered within [10, 90], which is [30, 70]? Well then No. 1 would place the text at [10, 50] instead of the desired [0, 40].\nThe root cause is that DataTable have no information of its child label, and can't decide what to align its child to.

If we change it to Future and then await it, then flutter emulators --launch x will await the completion of that process (wait until the user closes it).\nIf I don't await the process in the launch method, then I can't check the exit code. So, I guess I need to wait a short period (a second?) and if the process is still running, then assume it's a running emulator and not wait for it (we want to return the user to a terminal).

However, it occurs to me now that flutter devices includes the test device when passed the flag always; it doesn't list it only when it's running (since it doesn't really run like a normal device that can be connected to).\nAnyway, I've pushed a change to add the missing awaits and to automatically return from AndroidEmulator.launch() after 3 seconds if the process is still running.\nThere are two outstanding issues at the top; one is about Simulator location - I think we should probably just remove the TODO and assume the path is always this. If it's not, the worst to happen is that the simulator won't appear in the devices list.\nThe other one is about tests. I think the options are:\n\nLeave them until we've done --create and then create devicelab tests that create, list, launch, verify launch\nEnsure devicelab has some consistent AVDs (and iOS Simulator?) we can use\n\nIf we're going to do 1, it'd be good to have someone else check the code out and have a little test for sanity.

As part of that, one of the things I'm investigating is whether we can find a way to come up with a more general approach to PlatformView support in the framework that avoids adding platform-specific API like UiKitView etc.\nThis is problematic because these classes are tied to specific embedders, which makes them somewhat meaningless on other embedders, and forces custom embedder authors to maintain their own fork of the framework if they want to enable PlatformViews for their embedding.\nIdeally, I'd like it if we could get to the point where the framework exposes a set of basic classes that aren't platform-specific and the platform-specific bits could be done in a cleaner more pluggable way. I'm still evaluating the feasibility of this approach. Until then I'd like to hold off on adding more platform-specific cases to the framework.\nI think it's reasonable to keep this open while I dig into the macOS side and get back here.",

My suggestion is to redistribute the docs between PageStorageKey and PageStorage, pick one as the main article that introduces this system and code sample, while other one is introduced only briefly and refers back.\nI would prefer PageStorage being the main, despite that the key is used more often, simply because of the name. Here's how I would do it:\n// PageStorageKey\n\n/// A key indicating that the widget state is persisted in a storage after\n/// destruction and will be restored when recreated.\n/// \n/// Each key needs to have a value that is unique in its corresponding storage,\n/// i.e. the widget's closest ancestor [PageStorage]. To make it possible for a\n/// saved value to be found when a widget is recreated, the key's values must\n/// not be objects whose identity will change each time the widget is created.\n/// \n/// For more introduction, see [PageStorage]\n\n// PageStorage\n\n/// Establishes a subtree in which widgets can opt into persisting states after\n/// being destroyed.\n/// \n/// [PageStorage] is used to save and restore values that can outlive the widget\n/// (...)\n/// For example, when multiple pages are grouped in tabs, when a page is\n/// switched out, its widget is destroyed and its state is lost. By adding a\n/// [PageStorage] at the root and adding a [PageStorageKey] to each page, the\n/// page's state will be stored in its closest ancestor [PageStorage], and\n/// restored when it's switched back. (...)\n/// \n/// Usually you don't need to explicitly use a [PageStorage], since it's already\n/// included in routes (...)\n/// [PageStorageKey] is used by [Scrollable] if\n/// `keepScrollOffset` is enabled to save their [ScrollPosition]s.\n/// \n/// {@tool snippet}\n/// This sample shows how to explicitly use a [PageStorage] to\n/// store the states of its children pages. Each page includes a scrollable\n/// list, whose position is preserved when switching between the tabs thanks to\n/// the help of [PageStorageKey].\n/// \n/// (Your code)\n/// {@end-tool}\n/// \n/// See also:\n/// \n///   * [ModalRoute], which includes this class.\n///   * (...)\n\nMy apology if I happened to have escalated the problem. :)\nAlso, your ColorBoxPage can actually be a stateless widget!",

This creates a few \"inconsistencies\", but so far so good.\nFor example, LongPressGestureRecognizer independently tracks primary/secundary/tertiary buttons. Theoretically, allowedButtonsFilter could handle that, and allow for more complex customization, but these are sent as callback (such as onSecondaryLongPressDown). So unless we convert the 3 variations of each into a single and expose to the user (like onLongPressDown(int mouseButtons)), I don't think it would work. Given it is used in Editable, it is unrealistic to expect different longPress configurations. I think it is fine the way it currently is.\n\n\u2705 DragGestureRecognizer: I replaced where it tracked kPrimaryButton with support for anything. So now it is more versatile than ever.\n\nEasy ones:\n\n Add buttonsEventFilter support to GestureRecognizer\n  Add buttonsEventFilter support to OneSequenceGestureRecognizer\n  Add buttonsEventFilter support to ScaleGestureRecognizer\n  Add buttonsEventFilter support to EagerGestureRecognizer\n Add buttonsEventFilter support to SerialTapGestureRecognizer\n Add buttonsEventFilter support to PanGestureRecognizer\n Add buttonsEventFilter support to MultiTapGestureRecognizer\n Add buttonsEventFilter support to PrimaryPointerGestureRecognizer\n  Add buttonsEventFilter support to BaseTapGestureRecognizer\n\nRefactors:\n\n Add buttonsEventFilter support to DragGestureRecognizer | HorizontalDragGestureRecognizer | VerticalDragGestureRecognizer\n\nHarder ones:\n\n Add buttonsEventFilter support to LongPressGestureRecognizer\n Add buttonsEventFilter support to TapGestureRecognizer",

In the case of DoubleTapGestureRecognizer it sounds like we may want to leave it as is then since it sounds like it always needs to accept all buttons to prevent weird behaviors. Though I do worry a bit that not adding allowedButtonsFilter to some GestureRecognizers may lead to a inconsistent experience for a developer as they might expect DoubleTapGestureRecognizer to have allowedButtonsFilter like other GestureRecognizers do. @Piinks @a-wallen what are your thoughts on this?\n@bernaferrari what do you mean by relaxing? I can't tell the difference in the code.\nOption a) also sounds like a good idea to me given the setup of LongPressGestureRecognizer. I'm not fully understanding why we couldn't keep the default to button == primary || button == secondary || button == tertiary vs all buttons. Would allowedButtonsFilter still work as a disable in this case?",

Would allowedButtonsFilter still work as a disable in this case?\n\nSure, I can make this (52c85b2). AllowedButtonsFilter would disable it, but if there is no callback, it also auto disables it. The logic behind LongPress is \"if mouseButton matches callback, allow the pointer\". You could have the callback and use allowedButtonsFilter to cancel it.\nThe default value doesn't matter because isPointerAllowed already prevents multiple buttons (see the default: return false). But yeah, a bit of redundancy won't hurt.",

It gets called for both left and right handles, but never ever does anything for the right handle.\nif we know that it shouldn't be called when dragging the left handle, and never does anything when dragging the right handle - do we need this call at all?

This is especially an issue if obfuscate is enabled. Therefore, I will be updating it to strip manually just after creating the dSYM.\nThis approach is feeling a bit hacky and it really would be much nicer if we could get dSYM style dwarf out of dart's gen_snapshot directly, but I guess that's quite a stretch, right @mraleph @sstrickl?",

The Box would ask the Foo for its intrinsic size, the Foo asks its child, reports the answer back to the Foo, which gives it to the Box. If RenderObject.debugCheckingIntrinsics is true, though, the child might not set up a relationship with its parent, so when it later changes, it calls markNeedsLayout on itself, but it finds it doesn't need to call markNeedsLayout on its parent. The RenderBox never gets dirtied, so the cache isn't cleared. This seems like it would then start returning bad values...\nDo you still get the improvement if we just clear the cache on every frame? The binding in the rendering library already knows about box.dart so it would be reasonable for it to go and clear out the cache (you'd have to have a public method for clearing the cache, I guess, but that's ok...).",

I tried out your suggestion to clear the cache on every frame, by doing it at the end of drawFrame. This does still give the performace improvement, but it also causes some tests to fail internally with intrinsic check failures, probably because widgets might be marked dirty multiple times within a frame in between intrinsic checks.\nSomething else I tried was to clear the global cache instead before every RenderBoxs' intrinsic checks. This does not result in the failures, but the performace gains are not as significant - it averages to about 15% faster, down from 30% previously. This probably happens because there's still a bunch of wasted work recalculating intrinsics when the widgets are not dirty.\nI think what we might want here is to somehow hook into all implementations of RenderObject and when they mark themselves as dirty, clear the global cache. There doesn't seem to be a simple way of doing this though. Even if we could add some sort of debugAssertDoesMeetConstraintsClearGlobalCache method to RenderObject API (not that it's the best idea) and place it in RenderObject.markNeedsLayout, implementations such as RenderFoo don't necessarily need to call super.markNeedsLayout, and there's doesn't seem to be a way of reliably knowing that RenderFoo is dirty.\nThis does seem a bit difficult to implement correctly and I can't think of anything else that might solve the edge case you pointed out at this time. I guess an option here would be to settle for the smaller performance gains, but I'd like to think a bit more about this over the weekend :)",

Descendants of RenderObject can implement it, and it will be called in RenderObject.markNeedsLayout. In this case, RenderBox will implement it to clear the global debug intrinsics cache.\nTo make sure that clients do not override this logic in RenderObject.markNeedsLayout, we can add the @mustCallSuper annotation to RenderObject.markNeedsLayout. This doesn't look like a breaking change (from running internal tests).\nI'm a bit on the fence about this approach, because it feels a bit more difficult to explain to users how to implement it for non-RenderBox operations. Perhaps the method can be renamed to something like beforeMarkNeedsLayout as a generic callback for implementators of RenderObject to do work.\nOption B: Add a global intrinsics cache, always clear it before intrinsic checks\nExample: #72260\n~15% faster on average for the slowest 35 internal targets.\nWe can also go with the smaller performance gains with the advantage of keeping the cache invalidation simpler. This will involve just wiping the entire intrinsics global cache right before the checks.\n[Suggested] Option C: Make intrinsic checks lazy, relax checks\nExample: #72258\n~30% faster on average for the slowest 35 internal targets.\nPreviouly we discussed the need to use a separate cache for intrinsic checks, because we do not want to affect real layout. What if we instead simplified the intrisic checks so that we don't need a separate cache?\nThe eager intrinsic checks introduces additional caching keys due to the extra constraints of doing intrinsic computations with double.infinity, and constraints.min/max/height/width, which might never be encountered in the lifetime of the RenderBox. We could instead validate just the values that are already computed as part of real layout. The example PR above probably needs a bit more work and structure, but it shows this in more detail.\nThe gist of it is to make the checks lazy and use the real layout cache for the intrinsic checks. _computeIntrinsicDimension is augmented to do the intrinsics checks instead as and when values are returned. It checks if the returned values are not negative and finite, and attempts to check for min < max as and when the values are saved into the cache.\nOption D: Figure out some way to make it easier to turn the checks off\nTurning off the intrinsic size checks makes the tests ~35% faster on average for the slowest 35 internal targets.\n(Assuming the prior art for configuring golden tests is #16859)\nCurrently it is possible to turn the intrinsic checks off by subclassing either of the TestWidgetsFlutterBindings, and overriding the getter checkIntrinsicSizes. Perhaps we can make this instance property a setter or even a top level library setter (like goldenFileComparator) which will make it easier for users to toggle.\nThis is more convenient but I feel like it might end up being buried somewhere in the documentation as a configuration though. Perhaps we can add some sort of heuristic to the tool or package:flutter_test, for when tests exceed a certain time to tell users of the existence of that configuration to make it more discoverable too.\nOption E: Option D + any other option listed above\nOption D of making the flag easier to configure is not exclusive with the other options listed, and a solution could be a combination of those options.\n\nPersonally I like option C better, but I'm not sure if relaxing the checks is alright as they might still offer some value.
