If you need an exemption to this rule, contact Hixie on the #hackers channel in Chat (don't just cc him here, he won't see it! He's on Discord!).\nIf you are not sure if you need tests, consider this rule of thumb: the purpose of a test is to make sure someone doesn't accidentally revert the fix. Ask yourself, is there anything in your PR that you feel it is important we not accidentally revert back to how it was before your fix?\nReviewers: Read the Tree Hygiene page and make sure this patch meets those guidelines before LGTMing.",

Ask yourself, is there anything in your PR that you feel it is important we not accidentally revert back to how it was before your fix?\nReviewers: Read the Tree Hygiene page and make sure this patch meets those guidelines before LGTMing.",

If you need an exemption to this rule, contact Hixie on the #hackers channel in Chat (don't just cc him here, he won't see it! He's on Discord!).\nIf you are not sure if you need tests, consider this rule of thumb: the purpose of a test is to make sure someone doesn't accidentally revert the fix. Ask yourself, is there anything in your PR that you feel it is important we not accidentally revert back to how it was before your fix?\nReviewers: Read the Tree Hygiene page and make sure this patch meets those guidelines before LGTMing.",

He's on Discord!).\nIf you are not sure if you need tests, consider this rule of thumb: the purpose of a test is to make sure someone doesn't accidentally revert the fix. Ask yourself, is there anything in your PR that you feel it is important we not accidentally revert back to how it was before your fix?\nReviewers: Read the Tree Hygiene page and make sure this patch meets those guidelines before LGTMing.",

This debug check is the only reason, why the paintImage method needs to know the device pixel ratio, which it is currently reading from the global window singleton. That will not work in a multi window/view world. The method needs to read the dpr from the view the image is going to be drawn into. Unfortunately, it doesn't have access to that information. In this PR I changed it so that the dpr can (optionally) be passed into the method to enable the debug check and I made sure that everywhere in the framework we do pass it in. However, if somebody now calls paintImage directly without passing in the DPR, the oversized images check is disabled.\nAnother option would be to make passing in the dpr required. This would be a breaking change since there are two callers of this method in google3 (those could be easily updated, though). It does feel a little odd to require it just for the debug check, though.\nYet another option could be to move the check out of paintImage. However, I didn't really find a better place for it...\nWhat are your thoughts?",

Ask yourself, is there anything in your PR that you feel it is important we not accidentally revert back to how it was before your fix?\nReviewers: Read the Tree Hygiene page and make sure this patch meets those guidelines before LGTMing.",
