Is it enough to add my idea to the description so that we can discuss? Or is there any other way?\n\nIs linux still a build option (vs linux-x64 and linux-arm64 or similar)? If so, does it mean \"same as host\" or \"x64\"?\n\nNo, it isn't. I'm sorry for confusing you. I updated the description. Now, I want to run the Flutter SDK on an arm64 host.\n\nHow should the build output be structured for multi-arch output?\n\nAt the time of self-build, the build output will be output to build/linux/. It's the same as the current output directory structure. On the other hand, at the time of cross-build, it will be output to build/linux-cross/.\nHow about my idea?\n\nFor Linux, how is the sysroot handled?\n\nI have considered that an user can specify a sysroot prepared by themselves in the build option. I think it would be better to have an option for them to freely specify sysroot. Because Flutter Engine has similar options.\n$ flutter build linux --target-platform=linux-arm64 --target-sysroot=/target-sysroot-path\n\nBut If the Flutter SDK download the sysroot used to cross-build the Flutter Engine first, they don't need to prepare anything."

These weren't questions about how your patch works, these are questions that all stakeholders need to agree on what we want the solutions to be, not only for Linux, but for other platforms where we need this in the future such as Windows. (E.g., I'm not at all sold on having two different build directories whose contents depend on the host machine, vs., say, always doing linux/x64/... and linux/arm64/...)\nAnd a design document is the best place to have a discussion like that."

So, while each engine layer can easily cache-optimize its own operations, the ability for a sequence of layers to cache-optimize their combined operations is missing in so many configurations and gets expensive to recognize when the authoring code (the widgets) already knew how the operations combined before they were forced to express the ops as individual nested layers.\nIt appears that the framework code here can decide to \"cache and freeze\" the children so that if the children continue to animate, it can ignore the subsequent changes in the children. Existing cache stability mechanism all rely on the children actually not changing, but this code will enforce that condition (presumably because widgets undergoing a transition effect don't need to be animating themselves?)\nOverall, toGpuImage as an isolated mechanism should have similar performance to the caching in the engine layers in terms of getting pieces of scenes into images. But the resulting image can be dealt with more flexibly at the widget/RenderObject level than it can at the \"each op is its own layer\" engine level.\n\nAm I seeing this accurately?"

What if we could break those 2 concepts up and so you could still express your transition as \"drawScene(scene, geometric destination description (x,y or rects, nine-slice, etc), Paint, )\" and then it could be used as a common way to present modifications of a set of children. That could be combined with either automatic or explicit caching to be able to do the entire zoom page transition in one operation. Even without caching, it would be a much more efficient operation. toGpuImage or the existing engine cache would become implementation details, but the API being presented would be this more flexible one that is independent of those details and would work well with them."

FragmentShader is installed in a Paint so it would already be dealing with that. The transform is part of the operation just as if it would be with drawImage().\nWhat I'm saying is that if you can express your operation as a call to drawImage - as this PR already implicitly requires - then it could be expressed as drawScene(...) which has all of the same bells and whistles as drawImage, but operates on a scene fragment.\nWe're not adding API to the SceneBuilder, we're removing API and replacing it with a more flexible operation.\npushOpacity should have never existed, it should have been drawScene(children, Paint..setAlpha).\npushImageFilter should have never existed, it should have been drawScene(children, Paint..setIF()).\npushColorFilter should have never existed, it should have been drawScene(children, Paint..setCF()).\npushTransform could be replaced by some variant of drawScene(children) with a transform.\nAt that point, pushOpacity nested with pushImageFilter becomes an obsolete concept replaced by drawScene(children, Paint..setThis..setThat).\nAnd if the new transition involves perspective transforms, then it should already be expressable by the new mechanism because it can do anything you could have done with manual caching and a call to drawImage()."

Those methods on SceneBuilder could still exist as special cases of pushPaint, but if we had had pushPaint all along, many of the \"peephole optimization\" complications that were part of the reason for this PR would have never been an issue.\nAnd doing so combines 3 engine layers into 1, without any changes to framework code other than providing the framework with an opportunity to combine its layers if it so wishes.\nTo completely express most conceivable transition concepts, pushPaint isn't enough - we'd have to add a transform optimization into that. It isn't as \"mostly delete code with a few lines added\" trivial as adding pushPaint, but it is not that much work.\nThe longer term idea, though, is that pushSingleConceptFoo() is not a good API for us to have ever provided developers."

Instead, it should require that there is a Material widget in the subview itself.\nI think it is the same for portals.\nAlso, we should make sure that OverlayPortals are a drop-in replacement for Views. Basically, OverlayPortals simulate sub-windows. We should probably hold off on this until the View stuff is a little further along.

In short: we see that, with the current template, developers introduce breaking changes to the template in the first 5 minutes of their work, and then the smoke test is broken (often statically broken, so there are analyzer errors and squiggly lines). The effect is that the (otherwise very educational!) test/widget_test.dart file gets deleted or commented out. For that reason, the approach is to have relatively trivial tests that can't be broken (they don't depend on lib/) but that still provide some boilerplate (test('...', () {})) and links to documentation.\nNothing here is set in stone, though."

                      "bodyText": "Thanks @csells, replies inline:\n\nthe settings page action is hidden behind the debug banner, which could be mitigated with a tooltip\n\nWe were aware of the issue but decided to prioritize simplicity of code. What do you mean by mitigating the issue with a tooltip?\n\nI would expect settings to be a dialog on the desktop form factor and not a page to navigate to\n\nThat would make the code a lot more complex, and isn't necessarily all that clear cut. Desktop apps often open a completely separate window for settings screens, which would make things even harder to implement.\n\nI normally find myself having a shared Scaffold and AppBar between pages to reduce the duplicated code while providing a consistent UI between pages\n\nWe explored this. In many cases, AppBar will be meaningfully different between pages. This can be mitigated by creating a custom widget, of course, but that would make the template more complex. And it's something where we don't need to educate. The template educates about things like file structure, but extracting widget is something an intermediate developer is perfectly capable of.\nIn short, this goes back to the goals of the template: getting out of the way of an intermediate/advanced developer.\n\nthe item details page has no Settings actions\n\nThat is intentional. In most apps we're seeing, app-level settings aren't accessible from everywhere. Of course, a desktop app has its settings in the menu, so in that sense, it's available everywhere. But again, this is something an intermediate developer should be able to implement themselves. And it allows us to save code that would otherwise need to be understood, modified and/or deleted by the developer.\n\nI would expect the strings \"Dummy Items\" and \"Item Details\" to be in the arb and for the code to use them\nall of the tests except the first two in implementation_test.dart have great comments; would like great comments in all tests\n\nThis is also intentional. We've seen that developers, when starting projects, don't immediately implement i18n everywhere. It really damages perceived developer productivity when, instead of Text('OK') you have to write the i18n equivalent (in several files).\nIn the template, we show how to go about doing i18n in Flutter, and give you the files in the right places and with the right contents, but don't implement it fully for you. As a developer, you'd be deleting most of it anyway."
